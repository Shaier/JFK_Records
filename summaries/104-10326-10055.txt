This document is a message regarding the release of a classified document. A fax received appears incomplete, containing only a cover sheet, a one-page Copenhagen cable stating "no traces," and the first page of a Director cable requesting traces on Lee Harvey Oswald. The message states that unless the missing portions of the Director cable have some bearing on Denmark, the station cannot make a case against release of this material. However, they insist that crypts be deleted as indicated in the reference. The sender requests to be kept apprised of the date these documents will be released so that the station may inform the ambassador and liaison service chiefs.
