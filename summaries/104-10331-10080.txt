This document discusses a JFK Appeal memorandum being prepared for the DCI. HRG reviewers have mixed opinions on various aspects of the appeal. They don't support the "LICRYPT issue" appeal, but support the appeal in Attachment B. They can support the appeal of the four stations in Attachment C, but prefer a different approach. The State Department's involvement is also a concern. The State issue was raised with OGC who agreed on the need to include State.
