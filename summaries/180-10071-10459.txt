This document is a memorandum from John Moriarty, a staff investigator, to Clifford Fenton, the chief investigator, both working for the HSCA, regarding Mary Ceciliadell Bertucci. The memo details a phone call Bertucci made seeking Bill Brown and her subsequent conversation with Moriarty. She requested modifications to previous reports regarding "the reward," as she had reconsidered her stance and now wanted to accept the recompense. Moriarty checked previous files from Bill Brown and noted the addition of several new details, including her maiden name, date of birth, social security number, her claim that JFK was her first cousin, Judge Garrison being her attorney, and her current confinement to a hospital in New Orleans. Moriarty states that none of the new items have been verified.
