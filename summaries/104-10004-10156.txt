This document is a memo for the record dated June 1, 1964, summarizing a conversation with Frank Friberg regarding the Warren Commission's inquiry into Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Finland in October 1959. Friberg provided information about travel times to and from the airport and the Soviet consulate in Helsinki, the consulate's closing time on Saturdays, and the destruction of passenger lists at the U.S. consulate. He also agreed that cabling the Helsinki Station with additional points not covered by the State inquiry would be worthwhile.
