This document is a letter to Mr. Jack Kennedy from Michael Stratton. It concerns Court Wood, the son of a local attorney, who appears to be actively involved in organizing a local chapter of the FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE. The letter writer mentions that Wood has been meeting with "interested groups" and lecturing to students in several eastern cities. He also mentions meeting David Lacterman and Walt MacDonwald, who are also students and actively involved. The letter writer asks what action, if any, he should take in regard to his relationship with Court and his father, and requests that the statement be included in his permanent record.
