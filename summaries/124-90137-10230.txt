This document is a memo from the FBI headquarters to the New Orleans field office regarding Petros Moutsos, who was a CIA informant within the communist-dominated Greek Maritime Organization (OENO). His usefulness to the CIA has declined, and he wants to leave the OENO atmosphere. He is currently a crew member of the SS "Radnor," scheduled to dock in New Orleans. CIA plans to have Moutsos jump ship and travel to Cuba to conduct clandestine meetings, facilitated by an arrangement with INS. Moutsos will also attempt to contact his wife, Angela Boyer, who has communist ties. The purpose is to improve his position and resume their relationship, which could help in establishing contacts in Cuba. The FBI is instructed to keep this information confidential and promptly furnish any related information to the Bureau.
