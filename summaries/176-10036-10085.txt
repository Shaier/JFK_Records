This document is a CIA intelligence report from June 13, 1962, analyzing Vietnamese Communist efforts. It translates an analysis from a VC company commander in Ba Xuyen Province, written in early May 1962, regarding the impact of increased U.S. military aid to the South Vietnamese government. The VC analysis suggests that while American intervention has temporarily postponed a general offensive, the use of counterguerrilla tactics may backfire. The report also touches on VC policies, administrative structures, and economic reforms.
