This document is a series of CIA cable messages from November 1963 discussing the ZRPRIMA program, which aimed to recruit technicians from Western Europe for Cuba. The review concludes that the program has been largely unsuccessful due to factors like Cuban bureaucracy, reluctance of Cuban officials, and a lack of interest from potential recruits. The document recommends discontinuing intensive recruitment efforts but suggests remaining alert for opportunities to place resident agents in Cuba. It also highlights the positive response from most stations in implementing the program, while noting Cuban confusion and ineptitude in achieving their own goals.
