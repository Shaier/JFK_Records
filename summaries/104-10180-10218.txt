This is a memorandum from October 30, 1961, regarding a cover arrangement for an individual designated as AMIRE/1. The memo outlines a plan to employ AMIRE/1 at Roberts Electronic and Engineering Service as of November 1, 1961, as a consultant in the Southeastern US. Roberts Electronic is a backstopped cover device that will list AMIRE/1 as an employee for credit and employment references, paying him through bank transfers. AMIRE/1 will receive a U.S. Treasury form 1099 from Roberts at the end of the year, requiring him to file an overt tax return as an independent contractor. The memo requests that CCG be notified when the cover arrangement is no longer needed.
