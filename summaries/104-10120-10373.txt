This is a memorandum discussing a proposal to assess potential REDSKIN agent candidates using a cover organization. The agency will be using an employment service in Pittsburgh as the cover, with two psychologists conducting the assessments. Arrangements need to be made quickly for training and security clearance of the candidates, as SR Division plans to process a large number of agents before summer.
