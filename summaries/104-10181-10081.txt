This is a partially declassified CIA document from 1992 concerning Mrs. Sloboda, her children, and their potential relocation to Moscow. It originated from ISENSTEAD, DAD, addressed to COL. ROSS. The document suggests that information on Mrs. Sloboda's departure for Moscow is derived from a highly sensitive source. It advises against action by the London Embassy on behalf of the Sloboda children until more information is available. The document also discusses the possibility of the Embassy interceding on behalf of the children and requests information on USAREUR and DA intentions.
