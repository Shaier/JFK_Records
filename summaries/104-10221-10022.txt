This document contains a collection of memos, reports, and related communications from the CIA (and some external sources like the FBI) regarding Mitchell Livingston Werbell III. The documents span from 1959 to 1979 and focus on Werbell's contacts with the agency, his activities in Latin America (specifically Haiti and Cuba), his military weapons business, and his association with various figures and alleged illegal activities. They show the CIA's efforts to assess his reliability as a source of information, his involvement in counter-insurgency efforts, and the concerns around his name being mentioned and exploited in ways that could connect him to the agency. The records detail a mix of operational interest, security concerns, investigations, and decisions to manage or discontinue contact with him over time.
