This document is a CIA "Routing and Record Sheet" attached to a memorandum that assesses the potential damage to the agency from new allegations made by *Ramparts* magazine concerning CIA funding of tax-exempt organizations. The memorandum discusses how *Ramparts* obtained information, reviews CIA's past associations with listed organizations, and categorizes the types of organizations involved (funding conduits, those used for agent cover, etc.). It concludes that *Ramparts* likely used publicly available information and that responsible Headquarters elements have been notified.
