This document is a report from Havana dated August 21, 1959. It discusses the Cuban economic crisis, the Cuban government's financial status, and Castro's agrarian reform program. The source is a Cuban government official, who reveals that the Cuban treasury is running short of funds, and the reckless confiscation of agricultural properties would obligate the Cuban government to assume even more debts. The report also mentions government subsidies draining the treasury and growing unemployment of farm workers due to fearful plantation owners doing little maintenance work. The source believes that Castro would do anything to obtain money, including confiscating bank accounts and safety deposit boxes, and would eventually need a loan from another country.
