This document is a routing and record sheet concerning the review of a manuscript by David Phillips, specifically chapters 3, 5, 7, 8, 10 and the epilogue from his book "The Night Watch". The chapters are being reviewed for classified material, information learned while the author was a CIA employee, and material not in the public domain. Concurrent reviews are being conducted by various CIA divisions and offices. A publishing deadline necessitates a timely review and return of comments by June 11, 1976. A specific comment concerns a potential reference to Camp Peary as a CIA installation, which the agency has never officially acknowledged.
