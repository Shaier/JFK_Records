This document is a memorandum from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding Franc Pecar, a Yugoslav trade official in the U.S. The CIA received information from Joseph Merola, who claims Pecar is being recalled to Yugoslavia and wishes to remain in the U.S. The CIA requests any information the FBI may have on Pecar and suggests considering contacting Pecar to persuade him to return to Yugoslavia.
