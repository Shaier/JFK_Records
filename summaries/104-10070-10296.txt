This document appears to be a collection of internal communications, primarily memoranda and routing sheets, from the CIA. The documents relate to a covert operation, referred to as "Case 9145," which involves using a cover story to explain the resignation of an individual ("Acon") from the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) and his subsequent employment with the CIA. Leo Cherne, President of the Research Institute of America, is being asked to provide cover for this agent. The communications detail attempts to coordinate meetings with Cherne, secure his cooperation, and manage various aspects of the cover story. Later communications discuss additional activities and concerns related to the agent's cover in Paris, involving interaction with individuals associated with "The New Leader" magazine and the agent's sister. There is reference to efforts being made to get Mr. Cherne to sign documents related to this cover. It also reflects logistical arrangements such as arranging contact between the subjects, coordinating meeting times, and follow ups.
