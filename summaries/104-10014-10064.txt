This document is a report detailing information provided by a U.S. professor regarding a KGB official named Nikonov, who is the grandson of former Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov. The professor, who taught Nikonov in 1976, described him as intelligent but initially appearing ideologically hardline. Nikonov, now a deputy to KGB Director Bakatin, was hired due to their friendship and refused to act on the state of emergency during the August 1991 coup. Nikonov reviewed files to determine if Lee Harvey Oswald was a KGB agent and also conducted an inquiry into the fate of Raoul Wallenberg for Bakatin. The U.S. professor is currently instructing at St. Petersburg State University on a Fulbright grant.
