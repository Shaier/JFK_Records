This document is a multi-addressed cable concerning the "ZRPRIMA" program, an effort to recruit technicians for Cuba. A review shows the program has not achieved significant results and its continuation is not warranted. The Cuban performance accounts for the lack of success. The cable advises stations with active leads to continue efforts, but to cease generating new leads. It instructs stations to be alert for other opportunities to place resident agents in Cuba. The cable notes that most officials rely heavily on local CP approval and that responses from stations have been gratifying. The document recommends discontinuing the ZRPRIMA SLUG, ending the message.
