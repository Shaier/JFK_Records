This document discusses a covert employee of the Agency who is currently in the United States for training and under consideration for a sensitive assignment. Immigration authorities have requested to question the employee, but the Agency is hesitant due to the sensitive nature of the assignment and the potential for publicity that could jeopardize the employee's future. The Agency is considering allowing Immigration to submit questions through them, which would be answered by the employee and then forwarded to Immigration. The document also addresses a security breach caused by the employee's father, who revealed the employee's affiliation with the Agency. The Agency is recommending that no further action be taken until the seriousness of the security breach can be determined.
