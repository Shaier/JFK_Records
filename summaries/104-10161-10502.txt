This is a memorandum from the Operations Support Branch regarding the death of Adrian Fisher Sherman Jr. on September 23, 1978, in Monterey, California, due to a heart attack. Sherman was previously of interest to the Agency as a military detailee and had connections to the San Francisco Base. An FRD case officer discovered his body during a scheduled operational meeting. Some personal items are missing from Sherman's apartment, including a plan to assassinate Fidel Castro from the early 1970s. The DCI has been briefed on the case, and no further Office of Security action is required, but monitoring the case for 60-90 days is recommended.
