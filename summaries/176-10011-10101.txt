This document describes a clandestine operation involving the contamination of a shipment of Cuban raw sugar destined for the Soviet Union. The operation aimed to render the sugar unfit for consumption by introducing a chemical that would impart an ineradicable bitter taste. The value of the spoiled cargo is estimated to be between $350,000 and $400,000. The operation was completed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, involving a British merchant ship.
