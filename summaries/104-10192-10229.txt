This document appears to be a CIA cable concerning Orlando Bosch and related activities in Naples. It discusses Bosch's suspended sentence for transporting explosives, allegations about U.S. government involvement in WOFACT (presumably an organization or activity), and potential negative impacts on CIA operations. It also mentions concerns about further publicity of "revelations" regarding JMWAVE activity and potential exposure of combined OPS facilities. The document ends with an assessment of the incident's impact on security and planned responses.
