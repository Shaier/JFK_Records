This document is a deferred telepouch sent from Washington to Brussels, concerning a request from the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) for information on the Flemish Order of Militants (VMO) in connection with the investigation into the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. The message asks Brussels to discuss the committee's request with Nigale management, inquire about any connections between the VMO and Americans between March 1968 and 1970, and ask Nigale to prepare a report on the VMO for passage to the committee. Additionally, permission is sought to pass VMO excerpts from semi-annual reviews to the committee, with an emphasis on classified handling of any provided information.
