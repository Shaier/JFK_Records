This document is a request for confirmation regarding the declassification and availability of several documents related to Jean Rene Soutre (aka Michel Roux), an OAS captain. The request originates from staff and is directed to the Director in Paris, with limited dissemination to specific EUR and CIC departments. The documents in question are of interest to unnamed magistrates in Milan and potentially related to the JFK assassination investigation. The requestor proposes to suggest that the VYSWORD contact the National Archives directly, and seeks confirmation that the documents have indeed been declassified and are available there.
