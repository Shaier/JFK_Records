This memorandum, dated May 4, 1967, from Charles W. Kane to the Director of Security, concerns Edward P. Morgan. Kane discusses his early association with Morgan through the Society of Former Agents of the FBI, noting that they were both active in the Washington Chapter during the 1950s.

Kane then relays hearsay information about Morgan's FBI career (1940-1947), his success in Federal Communications law, and a period with the Office of Price Stabilization during the Korean War that reportedly led to conflict with J. Edgar Hoover. He touches on Morgan's unsuccessful bid for National President of the Society of Former Agents and his subsequent disengagement from the organization, blaming the Bureau.

Finally, Kane notes Morgan's high-profile social circles in Washington, D.C., and suggests individuals within the Agency who knew Morgan well, particularly Lyon L. (Slug) Tyler, who formerly worked in Morgan's law firm.
