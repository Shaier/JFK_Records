This FBI document, dated June 30, 1961, discusses a CIA request to contact an individual named Jorge Beliard, who works for Cubana Airlines in New York City, in connection with Cuban operations. The document outlines the Bureau's flexible position on whether to allow CIA to contact Beliard directly or if the FBI should act as an intermediary. It instructs the New York office to discreetly ascertain Beliard's willingness to assist in establishing courier routes and to provide observations if he is willing. The document also mentions that Beliard has been under development by the New York office and has provided data on Cubana Airlines operations and personnel. The FBI has not determined whether it would be in their best interest to allow the CIA to contact him and would decide if he's in a position to help.
