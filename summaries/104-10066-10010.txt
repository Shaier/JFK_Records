This document outlines the CIA's response to the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations' intention to investigate leads in Portugal, the UK, and Mexico related to James Earl Ray's activities. The committee is interested in Ray's brief stay in Lisbon in May 1968. The CIA is cooperating with the committee by providing access to records but suggests using Legatts to handle overt interviews with police and witnesses. The agency requests embassies to offer advice but avoid involving station officers in negotiations unless absolutely necessary.
