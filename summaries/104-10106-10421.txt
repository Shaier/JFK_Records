This document discusses a letter from an Australian Justice, A. R. Moffitt, to the CIA requesting information on the reliability of Mr. Herbert Itkin, who Moffitt described as a former CIA and FBI employee. Moffitt is inquiring into organized crime in New South Wales and considering evidence given during a court case in England involving Itkin. The document details Itkin's testimony in England, where he claimed to have been recruited by the CIA and to have worked for both the FBI and CIA until January 1963. The CIA's Office of General Counsel (OGC) provided Moffitt with copies of three affidavits relevant to Itkin's affiliation with the CIA and confirmed that Itkin furnished information to the CIA over a period of many years, but was not sent to England to collect any information for the CIA. The OGC's reply was sent to Moffitt through the same channels his request came in, with copies of both letters and affidavits.
