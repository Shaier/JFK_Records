This document is a CIA dispatch concerning Jose Maria Lasa Irrutibeascon. It details a meeting between Identity 2 and Lasa Irrutibeascon, along with Identity 1, on October 2, 1961. Lasa Irrutibeascon was requested to meet by his uncle, a Cuban official in Switzerland. During the conversation, it was revealed that Lasa Irrutibeascon's father, also a minor Cuban government official stationed in Switzerland, was in disagreement with the Castro government. Identity 2 gathered that Lasa Irrutibeascon wanted to get his father into the country with assurance of support. Lasa Irrutibeascon gave Identity 2 papers dealing with the organization and purpose of the DRD and expressed a wish to go to Switzerland to inform the International Red Cross about the inhumane treatment of Cuban political prisoners. In parting, Identity 2 had a distinct impression that Lasa Irrutibeascon had not really accomplished the primary objective of his visit. Further information on Lasa Irrutibeascon can be found in the referenced documents.
