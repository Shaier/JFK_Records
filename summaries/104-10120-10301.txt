This office memorandum, dated December 2, 1960, concerns Hidalgo, Baline N. Jr. It mentions a request for security approval for state certification of the subject, who has recently returned from a 30-day TDY to San Salvador. The subject's file is marked as non-derogatory, but there's mention of a former connection to the FBI and apparent reluctance from the State Department regarding his "interrogation." The memo asks if State should be consulted before approving certification for this TDY.
