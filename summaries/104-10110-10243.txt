This document outlines a plan to conduct audio surveillance on a subject, Manuel F. ARTIME Buesa, at a safehouse in Bethesda. The first phase of surveillance has been completed, and a second phase is planned in anticipation of the subject's return to the safehouse with a companion, Rafael Aurelio QUINTERO Ibarbia. The plan involves placing microphones and a telephone tap, using a cover story to explain the installation, and addressing the challenge of servicing the recording equipment.
