This is a SECRET document from February 1998, regarding the continued protection of cover as a method. It requests input on the potential damage that could arise from the official release of USG documents confirming CIA use of state cover in Moscow, Paris, Mexico City, and Buenos Aires. The document includes a series of questions designed to assess the impact of such a disclosure on embassy operations, relationships with host governments, specific activities, and potential hostile uses. The information is needed to meet a deadline imposed by the JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB).
