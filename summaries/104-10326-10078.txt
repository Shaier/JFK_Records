This document is a secret message from the Minsk station, dated July 31, 1995. It requests guidance from headquarters (HQS) on a question raised with JYVAPOROUS (likely a code name). The message refers to a previous cable from the US state department showing official displeasure because JYVAPOROUS was uncooperative in sharing their files on Lee Harvey Oswald, while they made some of the files available to Norman Mailer for his book. The Minsk station is seeking guidance from HQS on whether to follow up with JYVAPOROUS regarding their lack of reciprocity in the liaison relationship, based on prior discussions.
