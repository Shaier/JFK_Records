This document is a memorandum from the CIA to the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) regarding the release of the true names of CIA employees that appear in the JFK Collection. The CIA expresses concerns about the Review Board's existing guidelines for releasing the names of CIA employees in the JFK Collection. The CIA argues that the guidelines could compromise national security and the safety of current and former employees and that it is important to work toward a general policy of protecting CIA employees identified in the JFK Collection, with exceptions made for those individuals who are important to the story of the assassination. The memo also includes a letter from a retired CIA employee, Thomas J. Flores, objecting to the release of his name in the JFK Collection.
