This document is a memorandum for the record detailing a meeting between AMBUNNY-1, AMWHIP-1, and DAMICONE on May 25, 1965, in New York. The discussion focused on the possibility of using AMBUNNY-1 in an operation, with concerns raised about her background and potential risks. AMWHIP-1 suggested using a cutout to introduce AMBUNNY-1 to the UNSNAFU-19 installation. Additionally, AMWHIP-1 mentioned his inability to travel to Paris before mid-June, leading to the Paris operation being called off.
