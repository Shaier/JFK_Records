This document discusses a proposed declassification of a British Security Service (BSS) document for release to the JFK Assassination Review Board. The document, attached to a CIA document, describes a 1963 interview conducted by BSS with Lillian Sloboda, wife of a Soviet defector. The Review Board is interested in CIA documents related to defectors around the time of Oswald and the JFK assassination. The CIA proposes redacting references to BSS, CIA, and FBI from the document. The CIA wants to know if BSS has any serious objections to the release of a sanitized version of the document and requests a response by a specific date.
