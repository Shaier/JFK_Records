This document is a secret communication from Denver to the Director, concerning a "write-in" to the Denver NVTAG office from an individual claiming a past association with NWBOLTON. The document contains the text of two pages faxed to the NVTAG office. The first page is a note to the NVTAG director and Denver NVTAG, indicating the sender's concerns about potential negative actions by people known to them, specifically in relation to matters discussed with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House. The second page is a letter from "Robert Plumlee AKA WM H Pearson," dated January 28, 1996, addressed to Robert Vernon. Plumlee claims to have sabotaged a Denver Magazine article in 1980 because the documents and information he was providing were being given to the Denver NVTAG. He describes turning over boxes of government documents, pictures, and names and dates to the magazine, and mentions a meeting with the NVTAG and Paul Lee of the NWBOLTON-Denver Contact Division. He further states that his house was fire-bombed, and he was attacked in Evergreen, Colorado, after the meeting. He mentions his testimony to the Senate and Congress, which he says contains information about the Kennedy matter, and is currently classified.
