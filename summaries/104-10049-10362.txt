This document is a memorandum summarizing a tape-recorded conversation between Mr. William D. Pawley and an unidentified Cuban in Miami during October 1959. The Cuban, part of a group of wealthy anti-Castro Cubans, discussed plans for sabotaging the sugar harvest and their need for moral backing and funding. Mr. Pawley, however, was reluctant to provide financial support, citing disunity among anti-Castro groups and Castro's control over the country. The Cuban also mentioned contact with a representative of General PEDRAZA's revolutionary group in the Dominican Republic.
