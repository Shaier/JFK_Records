This document is a memorandum from the Director of Finance regarding a search for payments made to Howard Hunt. The search was initiated at the request of the Deputy Director for Management and Services. The Office of Finance searched expense records, station accountings, and travel claims, but found no undocumented payments to Mr. Hunt aside from one item for $1,600 that was written off without further accounting. It notes that all costs associated with Hunt's non-official cover assignment in Madrid were charged to the EUR Division, which is not normal practice. The document suggests questioning Mr. Karamessines about projects to which Hunt's operational expenditures might have been charged and requests approval to ask a cleared contact at Chase Manhattan Bank for a transcript of all entries into Mr. Hunt's account. It also states they are reviewing records of cashier's checks to see if any were payable to Mr. Hunt.
