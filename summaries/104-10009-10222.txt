This document is a letter from Richard Helms, Director, to Sir Charles C. F. Spry, Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization. Helms expresses gratitude for Spry's letter recommending against the declassification of Warren Commission document CD-971. Helms notes that an earlier inquiry was made in anticipation of further pressure for the release of Warren Commission papers, a pressure which has not materialized. As a result, there is currently no intention to release CD-971. Helms asserts that the points made in Spry's letter would provide reason to withhold the document from the public domain. The letter is dated November 26, 1968.
