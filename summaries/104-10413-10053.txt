This document is a memorandum regarding the debriefing of David M. Wilsted. It discusses the reorganization of the telephone system in Mexico City by the firm Intel, which is making it harder to access certain lines, especially those of the Czech Embassy. The document outlines strategies to circumvent these issues, including using apartment buildings and combining faulty line pairs. It also details the cost of obtaining a regular telephone in Mexico and lists personnel involved in tapping lines, as well as the basehouses and lines covered at each location.
