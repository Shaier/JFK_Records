This is a memorandum from Barry Harrelson, a JFK Project Officer, to Fred Wickham and Linda Cipriani, regarding the release of CIA employee names in JFK records. Harrelson expresses concern about the large number of names scheduled for review and the potential harm to the Agency if most are released. He suggests re-engaging upper management and preparing evidence for the ARRB to protect the names. The memo discusses the ARRB's previous agreement to protect names until May 1997 and the difficulty of developing sufficient evidence to protect all individuals under the Board's name-by-name approach. It raises concerns about the potential harm to national security from releasing a large number of names due to the ripple effect on assets, liaison services, and cover entities. The memo recommends revisiting the issue with the ARRB, balancing public interest in releasing JFK documents with the public interest in maintaining the Agency's security and cover practices. It proposes a compromise where the ARRB and HRG work together to identify employees directly involved in the JFK story, releasing only those names unless the Agency can prove current harm. The memo also notes the issue of State Department equities and the impact of acknowledging CIA officers under official State cover. It proposes preparing a memorandum to the Board, signed by the General Counsel, and discussing the issue directly with the Board.
