This document is an FBI record related to the JFK assassination records act of 1992. It details information about an individual named Franc Pecar and Joseph Raymond Merola. The document is a paper textual document classified as Secret, with restrictions labeled "1B." It was last reviewed in 1998 and requires CIA approval for opening. The memo discusses information received from the CIA about a commercial representative from Yugoslavia, regarding their potential connection to the Yugoslav Intelligence Service (YIS) and the possibility of them being recalled to Yugoslavia. It also mentions the CIA's desire to verify this information and consider contacting the subject to persuade them to return to Yugoslavia under CIA control. The FBI does not recommend approaching the subject because New York informants have said that they are not engaged in intelligence activities and because State recently denied clearance for approach in similar case.
