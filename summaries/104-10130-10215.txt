This document discusses a meeting regarding the potential problem of Anna Tarasoff's father visiting the Russian Embassy to obtain a visa for a trip to Russia, considering her CIA employment. The meeting explored providing cover for Tarasoff and her husband in case her father's visit to the embassy raised questions about their employment. It outlines steps to confirm her husband's existing state cover and create a retroactive army cover for Tarasoff, as well as credit checks. The document also discusses the approach to take with the father and whether he should be briefed on what to say about his daughter's employment, as he is unaware of her CIA ties. It was later found that the father had already visited the Embassy and listed Tarasoff under her maiden name.
