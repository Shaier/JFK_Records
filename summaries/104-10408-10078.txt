This document is a collection of letters and memos related to the House Select Committee on Assassinations' investigation into the death of President John F. Kennedy. The committee is requesting information from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) regarding the criteria for opening a "201 file" on an individual, particularly during the period of 1958-1964. The documents include the original request from the committee, a CIA memo discussing how to respond to the request, and relevant excerpts from CIA regulations governing the 201 file system. The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of interest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent information about that person.
