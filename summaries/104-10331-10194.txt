Here's a summary of the document:

This document discusses the decision to release the true name of Jose Marie Mankel, who was a contract agent for the CIA. An appeal to the President to keep his name confidential is considered unlikely to succeed due to the inability to articulate specific current harm that would result from the release. Information about Mankel and the program he was involved in has already been released. The document mentions Mankel's past involvement in narcotics operations, his recruitment as a ZRRIFLE agent in late 1960, and the termination of his Agency contract in Feb 1964.
