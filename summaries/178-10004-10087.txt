This document is a summary report on a CIA investigation into Project MKNAOMI, a project involving the CIA and the Army Biological Laboratory at Fort Detrick. The project involved the development of BW and possibly CW agents and associated dissemination systems suitable for clandestine use against human targets. The investigation was initiated after information was provided by CIA officers about past activities considered questionable.

The document details the project's management within the CIA, the relationships with the Special Operations Division (SOD) at Fort Detrick, and the types of activities undertaken, including the development of specialized dissemination devices and the maintenance of a stockpile of lethal materials. The discovery of shellfish toxin in a vault at OTS, along with other dangerous materials, led to a complete inventory. The document also discusses the disposal of the materials and potential connections to assassination planning.
