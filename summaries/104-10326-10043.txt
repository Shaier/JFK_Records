This document discusses the JFK Review Board's intention to declassify two Australian documents and four CIA documents that reveal the existence of an Agency-Australian liaison relationship. The CIA is attempting to prevent the release of the Australian documents, and will ask the Australians for their denial of permission, so that the Review Board will not release the documents.
