This document is a memorandum detailing tests conducted on an open sight hood for a 7.62mm Belgium (FAL) Rifle, along with tests on improved underloaded ammunition. The tests aimed to determine the hood's effectiveness in poor light and to improve ammunition performance. The memorandum discusses the sight's ease of use, accuracy, and performance compared to a peep sight and a scope. It also covers listener trials to assess the audibility of the rifle's mechanical noise and the round being fired. The potential for the ammunition filler to clog the silencer is also investigated. The memorandum further addresses issues with the sight hood's fit on different rifles and concludes with information about the availability of a scope for the rifle and its upcoming evaluation.
