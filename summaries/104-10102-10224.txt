This document is a draft memorandum from William Harvey to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), dated November 27, 1962, outlining an operational plan for continuing covert operations against Cuba. It acknowledges the constraints imposed by U.S. government assurances against invasion, but proposes a long-term strategy focused on intelligence gathering, economic pressure, political action, and the exploitation of internal tensions within the Cuban regime and its relationships with other communist nations. It advocates for a shift away from commando-style actions towards a more sustainable, clandestine approach, with the ultimate goal of weakening and isolating the Castro government. The memo also discusses the need for adjustments in organizational structure and procedures to facilitate this new operational plan.
