This document is a memorandum regarding Senator Walter Mondale's planned trip to Europe to inspect CIA covert intelligence sites in Norway. Concerns were raised about potential problems with friendly foreign intelligence services, and the discontinuance of agreements between the CIA and these services. The Committee discussed the pros and cons of the trip, and decided the purpose and procedures for such trips would be discussed with Senator Church. The SSC has also asked Colby for detailed briefings on National Intelligence Estimates.
