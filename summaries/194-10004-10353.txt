This document is an identification form for the JFK Assassination System, containing information about an agency record. The record, from INSCOM/CSF, concerns DOD-affiliated personnel incident investigations and is related to Manuel Marti. The document recommends case closure, classifying the information as unclassified but released with deletions. The attached document provides further context for the recommendation of case closure for Manuel Marti. The Army concurs with this recommendation, and it is now part of Marti's intelligence dossier. If new adverse information arises, a new action should be taken. Case closure under AR 604-10 does not automatically qualify Marti for a security clearance.
