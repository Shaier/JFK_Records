This is a memorandum from Robert D. Clark regarding a meeting in New York on March 2, 1978, with defectors and Vasia Gmerkin of CI Staff. The meeting involved a first mortgage put on a New York City property in favor of a devised facility nominee of the Agency. A classified document was signed, acknowledging that the devised facility is an instrumentality of the United States Government. Mr. Gmerkin and the undersigned registered objections to the mortgage.
