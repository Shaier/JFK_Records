This is a memorandum from J. Barry Harrelson, JFK Project Officer, to John Pereira and others at the DCI, DO, and DA, regarding CIA issues to be discussed at a November 17 JFK Board Meeting.

The memo highlights three specific CIA items on the agenda: reconsideration of releasing Warrenton, VA as the location of the CIA Record Center; a proposal to advance the opening date of the Nosenko NBR material; and the proposed release of reference to a CIA employee being under "integrated State cover".

The memo outlines the ARRB staff's positions on these issues, the Agency's potential positions, and requests for input and action from the recipients. It also mentions Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) financial records and documents containing lists of names and crypts. The memo concludes by stating the deadlines for advising the ARRB staff of the Agency's plans to brief the Board.
