This document is a report from INSCOM/CSF concerning Victor L. Trinkala. The report discusses information received telephonically from an anonymous male caller regarding Trinkala, who is an active duty US Army enlisted man en route to Vietnam. The caller, who identified himself as a former US Army Captain and Special Agent in the Counterintelligence Corp, stated that Trinkala was contacted by a "Soviet Agent" in New York City who learned that Trinkala is a Conscientious Objector. The caller plans to use this as a propaganda pitch against the US and suggested that the Army detain Trinkala in Oakland or cancel his orders. The caller also stated he planned to travel to Washington, DC to inform the "proper" authorities of the incident.
