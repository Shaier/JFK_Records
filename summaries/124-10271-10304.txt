This memorandum discusses a CIA operation involving a fictitious U.S.-based communist organization. The organization's activity is restricted to producing propaganda for foreign left-wing groups, aiming to penetrate revolutionary Arab groups in the Middle East. The Bureau requests samples of the CIA's propaganda, copies of communications sent to the mailing addresses, and the names of the officials related to the "Union for Revolution". The Bureau also needs to be kept informed and requires the information to be handled discreetly. The Internal Security Section and the Nationalities Intelligence Section will be informed.
