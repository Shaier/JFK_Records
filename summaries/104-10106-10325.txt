This document is a memorandum from William H. Godson of CI/R&A/O to the Chief of Counterintelligence Staff, dated November 1, 1977, regarding the Herbert Itkin file. It discusses two main divisions within the file: Itkin's involvement as an unpaid informant in a 1963 attempt by Haitian exiles to overthrow President Duvalier, and Itkin's attempts to involve Bernard E. MONCURE and the CIA in a custody dispute. The memorandum also mentions Itkin's connections to the Mafia and his recruitment by both the FBI and CIA. It highlights the defensive nature of the file, CIA's reactions to Itkin's tactics, and the protection provided to Itkin by federal authorities.  A side issue mentions Thomas L. Roberts, Itkin's former law partner, who became a CIA agent. Finally, it suggests that legal counsel John K. Greaney is most knowledgeable about the case. A handwritten note on the routing and record sheet requests discussing the black notebook matter with personnel and mentions that Paul Ghidali has re-reviewed the file.
