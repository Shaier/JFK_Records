This document is a dispatch from a CIA station chief to headquarters regarding a request for a review of files. It concerns an individual recruited in Havana in the fall of 1960 as a potential radio operator for clandestine operations. The subject, who had prior experience with an anti-Batista organization, underwent training but was never activated. The dispatch seeks headquarters assistance in identifying and locating the subject to determine if they could still be utilized for operations inside Cuba, while emphasizing the need to avoid contacting a former recruiter due to security concerns.
