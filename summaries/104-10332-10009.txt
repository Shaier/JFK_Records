Okay, here is a summary of the document:

This document is a memorandum regarding a request from the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) for access to a CIA report (the "Hart Report") on the Agency's handling of the Yuri Nosenko case. The memo discusses the issues involved in granting access, including concerns about protecting information on foreign liaison services and limiting the HSCA's use of the report to matters related to Nosenko's bona fides. It recommends approving limited access to a sanitized version of the Hart Report, conditioned on an agreement to limit the HSCA's use of the material.
