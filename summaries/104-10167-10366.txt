This document is a CIA intelligence report concerning the actions of Antonio Varona, Deputy Chief of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC), who is trying to gain support from President Chiari of Panama for a plan to overthrow Castro. Varona visited President Chiari to request him to host a meeting of Central American Chiefs of State on the Cuban issue and to invite President Kennedy to attend. He also visited Costa Rica. A group of Cuban exiles in Panama also requested Robles, Panamanian Minister of Government and Justice, to persuade Chiari to permit the establishment of a training base for Cuban exiles. However, Chiari reportedly discussed the matter with members of his government and it was agreed that permission would not be granted for the training site.
