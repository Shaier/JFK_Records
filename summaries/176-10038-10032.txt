This document is an incoming telegram from the Saigon office of the Department of State to the Secretary of State, regarding Task Force on Vietnam. It outlines opportunities for exploiting new management of national police and security services, and proposes developing a national communist party penetration service. It suggests integrating CAS (presumably, Central Intelligence Agency) efforts into the Vietnamese effort, requiring CAS officers at various directorates, and providing intelligence training to Vietnamese officers. It also discusses collaboration with USOM (United States Operations Mission) for developing a national police structure, consolidating civil police functions under the Secretary of State, delineating functions of public safety services, adopting a realistic training program, and developing an effective public safety service. The message emphasizes the need for support from the task force and above for these suggestions, including necessary personnel and budget additions.
