This is a memorandum for the record concerning possible animus of the DRE (Student Revolutionary Directorate) towards President Kennedy. The author recalls working on the funding of overseas elements of the DRE in Miami in the early 1960s. The author speculates on the DRE's possible involvement in the assassination, especially considering their potential connections to Lee Harvey Oswald. The author also recollects that the DRE leadership, particularly Luis Fernandez Rocha, expressed sentiments of disappointment that President Kennedy hadn't more forcefully pursued the "liberation" of Cuba.
