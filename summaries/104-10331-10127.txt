Here's a summary of the document:

This is a memorandum from the DO (Directorate of Operations), Focal Point for ARRB (Assassination Records Review Board), to the Chief of the Historical Review Group. The subject is the DO's position on identifying ERTHYROID/3. The DO strongly opposes the release of the phrase "a good KUBARK asset" related to ERTHYROID/3, arguing it would reveal him as a unilateral source. The DO explains that revealing ERTHYROID/3's identity and special relationship with the CIA would endanger him and could affect other recruited officers from liaison services. The memo is classified as SECRET.
