This document is a synopsis of a CIA report detailing the establishment of a "live address" for Gladys G. Danbrunt in Cheverly, Maryland in May 1961. The purpose was to receive communications for her, likely related to her son, Eustace H. Danbrunt, who was being held as a prisoner by a foreign government. Local residents were briefed to handle inquiries and intercept messages, and postal services were notified to forward mail. The document also provides background information on Dr. (Galloom), the householder at the live address, and notes a Western Union telegram sent to Eustace Danbrunt in Cuba. Daily contact was maintained with Dr.(Galloom) to monitor for any communications.
