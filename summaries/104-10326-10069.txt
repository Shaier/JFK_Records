This document discusses a JFK assassination seminar attended by a source, TZKILT/79, in Rio. The document critiques a video entitled "ZR -The Rifle That Killed Kennedy", based on a book by Claudia ((FURIATI)) and produced by FURIATI'S husband, NEI ((SROULEVICH)). The document notes that the video, despite containing Cuban CA line interspersed, is a well-done compilation of facts presented convincingly. The video splices interviews with former senior NWBOLTON officials and uses footage of a former DCI, making them appear supportive of the video's themes. It further incorporates interviews with various people claiming involvement with the Mafia and Cuban officials, including Castro himself, with the theme that the Cuban exile community, dissatisfied with the "liberal president," sought NWBOLTON to eliminate the president, and that Lee Harvey Oswald was a NWBOLTON tool staged to appear as a communist assassin. The document mentions that the source's contact with Cuban attendees will be a separate subject. A request is made for HOS to arrange pickup of the video/book from READY at COFC.
