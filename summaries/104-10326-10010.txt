This document discusses a request from the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) and the Department of State for assistance in approaching the FSB/SVR to gain access to the Oswald file. The ARRB, established by public law, seeks to identify, secure, and make available all records related to the Kennedy assassination. The document highlights that the ARRB's charter expires on September 30, 1998, and the old KGB file(s) are a major outstanding requirement. The document also notes that State has made it a top talking point in discussions with Belarus.
The ARRB Chairman specifically asks if the station can check with the FSB/SVR to determine whether the Russians retained a copy of Lee Harvey Oswald's KGB file in Moscow and if access to the file can be obtained for the ARRB. The document acknowledges the potential implications of such a request, including the possibility of the Russians requesting access to other files. The document emphasizes the need for a thorough dialogue on this matter.
