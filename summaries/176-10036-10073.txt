This document is a memorandum from Johnson to Rostow summarizing a meeting of the Task Force on Viet Nam on June 19, 1961. It discusses intelligence briefings on Cambodia and Laos, the local currency costs of increasing the South Vietnamese army, and a proposal by Cottrell to take military action in Laos to prevent infiltration into South Viet Nam. The memo also mentions Diem's proposal for a 100,000 man increase in GVN forces and the issue of Viet Cong interference with food supplies. Finally, it raises the question of internationalizing the border problem and suggests sending General Taylor to South Viet Nam.
