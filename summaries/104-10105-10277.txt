This memorandum summarizes a meeting between CIA officials, E. Howard Hunt, and his lawyers regarding Hunt's upcoming memoirs, "Undercover." The CIA sought modifications to the manuscript, including deletions and changes to specific items they considered classified or sensitive. Hunt and his lawyers were cooperative, and agreements were reached on some points. There was discussion regarding the potential difficulties of convincing the publisher to accept changes, and concerns about how the publisher might use the process for publicity. Hunt also shared a "comfort letter" stating his belief that the manuscript did not violate any agreements with the CIA or subject him to prosecution. The Agency plans to issue a press release regarding the review, and Hunt hopes the release won't be damaging to his book or motives.
