This document is an Information Report from the CIA, dated September 25, 1962, concerning a proposed joint intelligence operation between South Vietnam and Nationalist China in Laos. Tran Kim Tuyen, Chief of the Presidential Security Service, proposed to Huang Tien-Mai, Chief of the Chinese Nationalist National Security Bureau Intelligence Station in Saigon, to conduct joint intelligence operations. Tuyen envisioned establishing intelligence stations on the border between Laos and South Vietnam, as well as in Laos, to support joint Vietnamese/Nationalist Chinese agent operations. Huang concurred in principle but advised Tuyen to obtain approval from the Nationalist Chinese government before entering detailed negotiations. He telegraphed his headquarters in Taipei, outlining Tuyen's proposal and requesting early approval.
