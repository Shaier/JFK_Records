This document is a CIA telecommunication ("TELEPOUCH") regarding a request for information about Herbert Itkin. The request originated from a Justice A. R. Moffitt in Australia, who was seeking information on Itkin's reliability and affiliation with the CIA. The request came via the Australian diplomatic pouch, and the reply was sent through the same channels, including copies of affidavits. The Office of General Counsel (OGC) handled the request. The OGC's reply indicated that Itkin had furnished information to the CIA over a period of years but was not sent to England to collect any information.
