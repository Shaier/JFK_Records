This document contains notes from a briefing of ARRB (Assassination Records Review Board) staff by CIA personnel regarding the release of information about CIA stations, particularly in relation to the JFK assassination records. The discussion covers concerns about acknowledging the existence and activities of overseas CIA stations and the potential impact on host governments and relations with other intelligence agencies. Specific stations, such as Mexico City (due to its involvement in cables related to Lee Harvey Oswald), are discussed in terms of their importance to the story and whether their association with the JFK assassination should be released. There are also points raised about substitute language, other European stations, and the balancing act between public interest and agency confidentiality. Additional topics include the release of documents with crypts, and a disagreement about when to discuss the material with the board.
