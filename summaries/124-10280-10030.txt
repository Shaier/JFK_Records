This FBI document, dated July 29, 1964, concerns Rolando L. Cubela y Secades, who has connections to Cuba. An informant, MM 761-S, advises that CIA had contacted Cubela in Europe through Carlos Tepedino. Tepedino says he is the contact man between CIA and Cubela, and that Cubela has complained that the CIA will not furnish him with necessary equipment so he can take effective action in Cuba. The document says there is a plan under discussion to kill Fidel Castro, and the CIA was allegedly formerly in favor, but the plan was shelved because Attorney General Robert Kennedy would have no part in it. Now the plan has allegedly been brought up for consideration again. Cubela is supposed to participate, with men in Cuba, and possibly someone from Europe.
