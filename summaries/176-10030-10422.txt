This document is a memo from Arthur Schlesinger Jr. to President Kennedy regarding the reorganization of the CIA. It discusses CIA autonomy, the need for a doctrine governing clandestine operations, the relationship between operations and policy, and the need for effective control over CIA activities. Schlesinger suggests ways to alleviate problems, including State Department clearance for operations, a review of the Controlled American Source program, and a reconstitution of the intelligence structure with better coordination and oversight. He recommends a drastic overhaul of the State Department to enable it to assume effective command in intelligence matters.
