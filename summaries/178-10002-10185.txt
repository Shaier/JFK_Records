This document is a memorandum from William J. Murray, of the CIA, to the Inspector General, concerning questionable activities related to Jose Raul Martinez Nunez, a Cuban airline pilot. In 1960, Martinez was approached by the CIA to potentially arrange an accident involving a chartered Cubana Airline flight carrying Raul Castro Ruz. Headquarters initially offered a payment for a successful operation, but later instructions were issued to disregard the earlier plan. Martinez ultimately reported that he had no opportunity to arrange an accident. The document also mentions Martinez's defection to the U.S. and notes related cables.
