This document discusses the difficulty of obtaining a Mexican visa through normal channels, particularly due to the large backlog and concerns about Cubans becoming public charges. It suggests alternative approaches, including using high-level Mexican officials or Cuban friends with Mexican contacts, and considers the potential use of the LITEMPO visa channel. The document also advises against simultaneous action by the applicant and the station, suggesting that the applicant try on their own first. Finally, it addresses potential questions about the applicant's ability to re-enter PBPRIME and recommends involving the station case officer if necessary.
