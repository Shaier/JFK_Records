This document is a CIA information report from January 4, 1963, concerning the undiminished prestige of Fidel Castro in Latin America. It references a report from December 1962 based on information from a British service quoting a Yugoslav journalist who recently toured Latin America. The report suggests that Castro has maintained his prestige among his supporters despite the recent crisis, and that Latin American communist parties are becoming increasingly divided. It also includes British comments disagreeing with the impression that Castro's prestige remains high, noting that Cuban exiles in Venezuela are disillusioned by the Cuban crisis.
