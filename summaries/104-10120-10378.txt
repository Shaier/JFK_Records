This memorandum discusses a proposal to change the policy for processing potential REDSKIN Agents. The proposal involves using a nonofficial cover, specifically TSD's Psychological Assessment Associates firm, to conduct A&E assessments of candidates before disclosing Agency interest or classified information. The memo also mentions credit checks conducted on staff A&E members, and potential need for a different cover for the program. An attached memo is referenced.
