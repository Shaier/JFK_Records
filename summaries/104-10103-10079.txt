This document is a draft memorandum to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) from William Harvey, dated November 27, 1962. It proposes an operational plan for continuing operations against Cuba following the Cuban Missile Crisis. The plan outlines assumptions, objectives, and specific actions in areas such as intelligence collection, political action, economic warfare, and paramilitary operations, with adjustments considering the changed circumstances. It also recommends organizational and procedural changes within the CIA. A second, shorter document provides an alternative operational plan for Cuba.
