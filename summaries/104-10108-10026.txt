This document appears to be a handwritten note or memo regarding the search for a photograph related to the assassination. It mentions a conversation with Jim Lollis, the Deputy Chief of the Ground Photo Services Branch, about the lack of a photo of "bums" in police custody at the scene of the assassination. The note also mentions contacting Herb Simmons of the Document Services Group to arrange for a request to Newsweek for a photo from New York. Simmons reportedly declined to make a domestic photo request without authorization and did not recommend it as there was no plausible reason for a "State" person to be requesting the photo.
