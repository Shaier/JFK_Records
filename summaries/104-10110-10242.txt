This is a memorandum regarding audio surveillance of a subject, Manuel F. ARTIME Buesa, at a safehouse in Bethesda. The first phase has been completed, and a second phase is planned upon the subject's return. The District Field Office has been assigned the case, and plans are in place to install microphones and tap the telephone, with recordings being made in a crawl space. A cover story has been developed for the installation and servicing of the equipment. The memo anticipates improved audio quality but notes the challenge of timely recorder maintenance.
