This document is an information report from the CIA regarding an appeal to President Kennedy by South Vietnamese rebel officers located in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The officers, led by Colonel Nguyen Chanh Thai, presented a proposal to the U.S. Embassy via a cover letter to Ambassador Trimble. They criticized the Diem government's handling of the Viet Cong and suggested President Kennedy reassess U.S. policy, aiming to replace Diem with a more representative government. The proposal was presented in English, French, and Vietnamese. Major Pham Van Lieu informed an embassy officer of the group's expectation to be released from Cambodian custody soon, hoping for asylum in the U.S. and planning to fight Diem before the Viet Cong.
