This document is a progress report on the LIANCHOR project in Mexico City from December 1967 to May 1968. LIANCHOR is a leftist writer press service. The project produced 35 articles distributed to 20 newspapers, but has not achieved its objectives. The Mexico Station is attempting to convert the operation into a more effective and leftist one, replacing some writers. The document discusses the organization, intelligence production, and effectiveness of LIANCHOR, including the search for a replacement for the P/A (LINLUCK), involvement in covert action against Soviet poet Yevgenyi YEVTUSHENKO, and views on LIANCHOR's effectiveness by the owner/director of "EL IMPARCIAL". It also covers finance, support, and plans for the future of the project, including the possible recruitment of new personnel and testing for indications of effectiveness to determine the future direction of the LIANCHOR project, with the potential conversion to a roof project for singleton leftist writer assets.
