This document is a report from a Select Committee investigating alleged US involvement in assassination attempts on foreign leaders, primarily focusing on the period of the Cold War. It examines specific cases like those of Fidel Castro, Patrice Lumumba, Rafael Trujillo, Rene Schneider, and Ngo Dinh Diem. The report delves into the historical context, the CIA's role, the extent of authorization from US leadership (including Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy), and the ethical implications of such actions. The committee grapples with conflicting evidence, the use of euphemisms to obscure intent, and the challenges of assessing past events within the complex framework of national security and international relations.
