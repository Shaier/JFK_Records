This document is a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) telegram report about statements made by Manolo Ray, an exile leader of the People's Revolutionary Movement, concerning Cuba in October 1961. Ray said he opposed any invasion of Cuba, believing Castro's overthrow should come from internal resistance. He stated the MRP was well-organized, supported across Cuban society, and that most of the population opposed Castro, with the MRP gaining more support than the original revolution. The information came from an official British service with contacts among exiles in Caracas.
