This document is a CIA case study analyzing the bona fides of Yuri Nosenko, a KGB defector. It examines his background, intelligence, motivations, and operational circumstances, comparing his statements to information from other sources and specialists. The analysis explores various hypotheses, including Nosenko being a genuine defector, a KGB plant, or simply misinformed, ultimately concluding that Nosenko was a dispatched agent controlled by the KGB. The document provides detailed evidence and reasoning behind this assessment, questioning the accuracy and completeness of Nosenko's accounts and the negative security implications of accepting him as a legitimate source.
