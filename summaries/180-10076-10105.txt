This document is a memorandum from Lynn Loisel to Louis Ivon, regarding a phone call from Jimmy Johnson about David Ferrie and the Smith case on January 10, 1967. Johnson, a former associate of Ferrie, provided information to the office as a favor. He stated that Ferrie contacted someone named Pershing about a Cuban woman's name, had spoken with a lawyer about being investigated, and possesses army paraphernalia. Ferrie also showed nude pictures to young boys, was alarmed by a police car, and had a twin-engine beachcraft at his disposal. Ferrie and Steve Littleton discussed landing the beachcraft on a little island. Johnson believes they may have flown a smaller airplane to the island to look at a landing spot.
