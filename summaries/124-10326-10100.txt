This document is a memorandum from the FBI to A. H. Belmont concerning James Angleton of the CIA. It discusses Angleton's practice of providing confidential information to the FBI outside of regular CIA channels, with the understanding that the information cannot be traced back to him or the CIA in FBI reports. Angleton objected to the FBI's method of attributing this information to "Confidential Informant T-2" as it revealed the information's origin. The memo suggests creating a procedure where Angleton is referred to as a Bureau informant with a temporary symbol number to protect his identity.
