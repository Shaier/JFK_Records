This document is a memorandum regarding Nestor Antonio MORENO Lopez (AMICE-27). It details his background, involvement in anti-BATISTA and anti-CASTRO movements, and his connection to the AMTRUNK Operation. The memo suggests that while MORENO was a sincere anti-CASTRO revolutionary, his lack of discretion and trust in individuals like Tad SZULC and Jorge VOLSKY compromised the security of the operation.
