This document is a memorandum from the CIA to the JFK Assassination Records Review Board, expressing strong objections to the release of names of individuals who have worked for the agency under cover. It argues that releasing these names would breach agreements, compromise national security, and put individuals at risk. The memorandum proposes using pseudonyms or generic job descriptions instead of true names.
