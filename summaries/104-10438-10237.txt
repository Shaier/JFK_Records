This document is a collection of memoranda, reports, and news clippings concerning a review of deletions in the book "The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence" by Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks. The review process involved various components of the CIA and other government agencies assessing whether previously deleted items could be declassified or were already in the public domain. It also discusses efforts at coordination, disputes about the continued classification of certain items, and potential consequences of declassification. Some pages have notes attached to them in the margins.
