This document is a memorandum from Dean Rusk to the President (presumably of the United States) regarding a meeting with President Lopez Mateos of Mexico. It outlines key points of interest for the United States in the meeting, including maintaining close relations, controlling Castro/Communism, and Mexico's role in the Alliance for Progress. It also covers topics such as Red China, disputed tracts on the Rio Grande, narcotics control, and a desalination plant in Tijuana. The document also anticipates points that Lopez Mateos is expected to raise, such as the salinity problem on the Lower Colorado River, the termination of the Bracero program, US trade policies, and the Chamizal Settlement. The memo emphasizes the importance of respecting Mexico's sovereignty and avoiding any appearance of subservience.
