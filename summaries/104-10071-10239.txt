This document references a "case" prepared for discussions with the British. The paper was to be used as a basis for the discussions, with the aim of gaining British consent to further joint development. The discussions were expected to begin sometime after April 19th. However, the case was not brought up during the discussions because the environment was not favorable at the time.
