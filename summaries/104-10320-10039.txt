This is a letter from Richard Helms, Director of the CIA, to Sir Charles Spry, Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization. Helms thanks Spry for his letter recommending against the declassification of Warren Commission document CD-971 and states that there is no current intention to release the document. He notes that Spry's letter provides reasons to keep the document out of the public domain should the question of release arise in the future.
