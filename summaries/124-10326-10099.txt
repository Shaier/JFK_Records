This document discusses the method of transmitting mail to James Angleton of the CIA, specifically how it should be addressed to the Director of CIA, Attention: James Angleton, and the approval of this method by Allen Dulles. Angleton also requests that his identity not be revealed to other agencies when the Bureau disseminates information to him and other agencies, as he is involved in sensitive projects like Israeli Intelligence, and exposure could prejudice CIA operations. Attached is a memorandum to all Section Chiefs regarding this matter.
