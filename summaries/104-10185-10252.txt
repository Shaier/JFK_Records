This memorandum discusses the approval and planned use of a safehouse for AMMUG-1. The safehouse, located in Hunting Towers, Alexandria, was viewed and considered adequate. Inventory of household equipment is planned, and the move-in is contingent on debriefing completion. Furthermore, the memo indicates that the Safehouse Branch will no longer need to seek prospective apartments for A-1.
