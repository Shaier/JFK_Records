This is a memorandum from J. Barry Harrelson, DCI/CSI/HRG, JFK Project Officer, to Fred Wickham, DO Focal Point for JFK Board, regarding an ARRB (Assassination Records Review Board) request for additional information and records related to CIA-7, specifically concerning the Mexico City Station. The memo references a previous ARRB memo and lists five footnotes from the history of the Mexico City Station that ARRB Staff cited as possible assassination-related records. The memo requests copies of the source documents for these footnotes, providing the text associated with each footnote to aid in identification. It also notes that Mr. Gunn from ARRB will be reviewing additional material and requests the documents or a status of the search by February 20, 1997.
