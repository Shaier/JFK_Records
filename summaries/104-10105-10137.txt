Here's a summary of the document:

This is a routing and record sheet concerning the review of a manuscript submitted by Mr. David A. Phillips, a retired Agency staff employee. The manuscript contains three chapters of a book he is preparing. The review is to determine if the material is classified, was learned while employed by the Agency, or has not been placed in the public domain.

The author has previously submitted other chapters which were approved with deletions. Coordination for review is being conducted with various divisions and staff. The office requests comments before COB 16 Jan 1976. CCS recommends a specific deletion related to identifying Camp Perry as an Agency training site due to its sensitive nature.
