This document is an intelligence report about a Christian Democratic regional seminar for Central American leaders held in Alajuela, Costa Rica, from September 19-25, 1971. The report details that the seminar's true purpose was to conduct a detailed analysis of the political situation in Central American countries. A representative from the Institute for Christian Democratic Formation (IFEDEC) requested that representatives from each country prepare written replies to a questionnaire about the political situation. Representatives from Costa Rica and Nicaragua reacted negatively and refused to answer, believing it was a ploy to gather information. The representative from IFEDEC explained that the information was needed by the Latin American Center for Information (CIDAL), an organization founded in Caracas by the American Christian Democratic Organization.
