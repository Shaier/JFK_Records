This document is a memorandum from the FBI to Mr. L'Allier regarding the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC). It discusses a draft article from the CIA that attacks the FPCC, which the CIA intends to plant in a leading US publication. The FBI is informing the Nationalities Intelligence Section about this and seeking their input, specifically if the FBI objects to the CIA using information previously shared by the Bureau in the article. Mrs. Roman (CIA) offered the Bureau the chance to review the draft before publication.
