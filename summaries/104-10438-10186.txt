This is a memorandum for the record, dated August 23, 1976, concerning Frank Sturgis. Jon French of DCD received information from his Miami office about Sturgis from a contact who got it from Oscar Freely, who is writing a book on Sturgis. Sturgis is scheduled to appear on the Tomorrow Show on August 24, narrated by Tom Schneider, and he recently returned to Miami after taping the show in New York. While in New York, Sturgis met Marita Lorenz and obtained a book from her that appeared to be cryptographic material related to Albania, with "mathematical matrix" copies. Sturgis is trying to contact Senator Baker to give him the material. DCD plans to monitor the situation to see if the material is given to Baker. Tech that D'ED should release and ADDO and Phil FENDIG- lea will do.
