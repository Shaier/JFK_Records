This document outlines a 1959 Office of Security operation involving a foreign head of state, a Hollywood actress, and Robert Maheu. The operation entailed arranging social engagements and private meetings between the head of state and the actress during visits to Los Angeles and New York, potentially including the rental of a private residence. The report discusses concerns about publicity, the actress's background, and the role of Gregson Bautzer in the arrangements. The Office of Security investigation indicates that Maheu was not directly involved in introductions and that Bautzer may have acted as a front man for all arrangements.
