This document is a memorandum of a meeting with Dr. Miro, a Cuban exile leader, in New York City. Dr. Miro expresses strong concerns about the lack of progress in efforts to support internal resistance and clandestine operations in Cuba, and he complains about the Agency's handling of these efforts. He feels that the Agency is bypassing the Council and dealing directly with groups, leading to disorganization and undermining his leadership. He also voices frustration with the lack of resources and arms being provided to resistance fighters in Cuba, and he worries about the future of Cuba and the role of the Agency in supporting groups that may be unsuitable to govern. He expresses a willingness to resign if his concerns are not addressed and if he is not given more responsibility and control over Cuban exile activities. The document also details a number of specific issues related to propaganda, finances, personnel, and coordination within the Cuban exile community.
