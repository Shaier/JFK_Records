This document is a secret teletype message from Brussels to Washington, concerning a subject called "NIFLAIR - FLEMISH ORDER OF MILITANTS" (WNINTEL NIGALE). It discusses a contact's (NITRUST's) reluctance to share information with the House Committee on Assassinations due to concerns about the Freedom of Information Act and the potential for leaks. The message also mentions a previous connection between the Flemish organization and an American Nazi party member. The sender requests specifics on FOIA mechanics to address NITRUST's concerns and is concerned that despite assurances of handling information sensitively, NITRUST has not been persuaded that they are holding the line.
