This document is a SECRET deferred telepouch from May 1978. It concerns the Vlaamse Militantenorde (VMO), noting a discrepancy in information received from "NIGALE" regarding the VMO. The message states that there is no information regarding contacts between VMO members and American citizens between 1968 and 1970, and that preparing a report on the subject would be inopportune. The sender is also opposed to passing articles from reports to a committee. The file number is 008-002-009/3. E2 IMPDET.
