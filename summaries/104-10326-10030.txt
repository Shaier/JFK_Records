This is a Secret document dated March 7, 1997, from the Staff and intended for priority director with limited distribution to Chief/OCC info LA/FIGCC concerning the results of contact with a former employee regarding the JFK Assassination Record Collection Act. The document discusses a meeting with a subject regarding the possible release of documents containing his name. The subject had no objection to the release, noting he was previously subject of an action by host government which was heavily publicized locally. He feels he is already known in Costa Rica and further disclosure will not do harm. The subject was impressed and grateful to TQHIGHROAD for providing the heads up.
