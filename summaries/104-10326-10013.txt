This document discusses the possibility of the US government, through the ARRB, gaining access to BKGB (Belarusian KGB) records related to Lee Harvey Oswald's time in Minsk. It outlines past attempts to obtain these records, the individuals involved on both sides, and potential complications, including the BKGB's perceived lack of benefit from past access granted to author Norman Mailer. It requests guidance and authorization from headquarters on how to proceed with future requests from the ARRB regarding this matter.
