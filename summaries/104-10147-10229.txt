This document is a memorandum from S. D. Breckinridge to Ray Reardon of the Office of Security regarding agency employees with the surname Bishop. Breckinridge is requesting photographs of Agency employees with the last name Bishop who were employed in the 1960s to be shown to witnesses who claim to have known a man named Morris Bishop. The attached pages contain excerpts from the OPFs (Official Personnel Files) of several employees with the last name Bishop, including information about their dates of birth, work locations, positions, physical characteristics, and dates of service with the Agency. Breckinridge is attempting to gather these photographs to assist in identifying a man named Morris Bishop.
