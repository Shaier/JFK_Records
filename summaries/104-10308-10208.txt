This document discusses a plan to exploit a potential visit by Khrushchev to Cuba in 1960. The plan involves instigating a massive church manifestation in Cuba to express protest against the visit and spreading rumors, originating outside of Cuba, of an assassination attempt on Khrushchev during his visit. The CIA is directed to avoid actions that would endanger Station assets in Cuba, which are involved in encouraging the church rally. The plan also includes efforts to spark similar rallies in other Latin American countries and to spread rumors of assassination attempts through various media channels.
