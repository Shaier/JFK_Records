This document is a CIA "Target Study" from December 2, 1970, on Jesus Cruz Gonzalez, a Cuban press attache in Mexico City, and his wife Mercedes Martinez Moreno. It details their biographic data, personal history, activities, contacts, political leanings, and psychological assessments to determine any potential vulnerabilities for intelligence purposes. The study concludes that Cruz is primarily dedicated to press affairs, with few opportunities for intelligence assignments, and lacks any clear vulnerability. The station is still attempting to recruit one of Cruz' contacts, who would provide better personal assessment of Cruz' assignment in Mexico.
