This document discusses the possibility of obtaining files on Lee Harvey Oswald from the NWBOLTAN government. The files were offered to the US government (USG) in 1992, but the NWBOLTAN representative expressed reluctance to share them due to the USG not releasing all information related to its own investigation of the Kennedy assassination (the Warren Report). The NWBOLTAN representative suggested providing summaries of the files instead. The FBI was determined to have primacy in this matter. The memo concludes by stating that the agency will check with the FBI regarding the status of their dialogue with the NWBOLTANs.
