This document is a memorandum from the Chief of Security Analysis Group, dated June 23, 1976, regarding Manuel L. DE ARMAS. It references attached cable traffic concerning DE ARMAS' "defection" to Cuba in April 1976, where he claimed to be an ex-CIA agent and made allegations about CIA operations. The memo discusses Agency interest in DE ARMAS, focusing on his claims about Agency operatives and assets. It provides information on individuals mentioned by DE ARMAS, including Office of Security file searches and possible identifications, concluding that DE ARMAS may have been given a list of known or suspected agency assets by the DGI as part of a Cuban counter-intelligence campaign. The memorandum ultimately concludes no further action is necessary.
