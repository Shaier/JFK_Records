This document is a classified message from October 11, 1962. It discusses the political climate in Jamaica regarding the potential establishment of an AMBUD delegation. The message conveys concerns about the Jamaican government's desire to avoid overt involvement in the Cold War, the potential for a negative reaction from the large Cuban community in Jamaica, and the risk of undermining existing cooperation with RUABBE services in Cuban objectives. The message suggests that any attempt to involve the Jamaican government against its will could be detrimental. It also expresses reluctance to have AMBUD representatives visit Jamaica unless the political climate improves, suggesting that the station would insist on no public announcements before the Jamaican government makes a decision. Finally, the message suggests that station personnel should deny responsibility for AMBUD to RUABBE.
