This document is a summary of a 1978 interview with Arnold Arehart, a technician who worked in a CIA/Mexican liaison tapping operation in Mexico City starting in 1960. Arehart describes his role in maintaining the equipment used to monitor and tape phone conversations. He was the only American in the base, working alongside Mexican monitors who summarized the conversations, with summaries and tapes passed on to Anne Goodpasture and occasionally Win Scott. The base monitored thirty phone lines, focusing on Cuban, Soviet, and other phone conversations, though Arehart was not aware of any instructions or directives. Arehart claims that Lee Harvey Oswald never came to his attention, and that he was unaware of the fate of the tapes.
