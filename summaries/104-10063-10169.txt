This document is a CIA agency message, dated July 6, 1973, with restricted handling, sent from Paris to priority headquarters. It references previous communications regarding Black Panther members George Edward Wright, George Brown, Melvin McNair, Jean Carol McNair, and Joyce Rillerson, who arrived in Paris from Algiers. A clandestine organization has provided them lodging and training. Efforts are underway to arrange plastic surgery and false documentation to facilitate their clandestine re-entry into the US. A request is made for available photos of the individuals to aid in identifying them before surgery.
