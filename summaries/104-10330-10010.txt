This is a memorandum from John Pereira of the CIA/Historical Review Group to David Marwell, Executive Director of the ARRB, concerning sensitive information related to Mexico City. It discusses a statement prepared by the Directorate of Operations regarding records related to telephone tap operations in Mexico City, explaining the sensitivity of the records and the need for protection of sources, methods, and liaison equities. Releasing information that acknowledges the joint telephone tap operations between the USG and Mexican liaison could negatively impact current operations and relations with the Mexican liaison service.
