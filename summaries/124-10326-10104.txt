This document is a memorandum from D.J. Brennan Jr. of the FBI to W.C. Sullivan, dated January 13, 1967, concerning the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and information received from James Angleton. It recommends discontinuing the practice of placing copies of Bureau Informant 100 material in a separate control file (62-99724) created in 1953 for memoranda from Angleton. The control file was established to monitor Angleton's liaison and matters not reported through normal channels, but it is now considered obsolete as the information is filed elsewhere and rarely used. The memo suggests the control file continue to be used for retention of mail of a policy nature.
