This document is a secret message from March 5, 1969, concerning an individual ("SUBJ") who has contacted Zurich CG again. SUBJ claims to have radio and TV time on the evening of March 6 and will reveal information about alleged W of IRM contacts unless assurances are received that promises made by US officials will be honored. The message requests HQ confirmation on SUBJ's priority and any WOFIRM or LN HARP ties. The file is to be deferred. The message also references previous communications.
