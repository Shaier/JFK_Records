This document discusses a request from the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations to pursue leads in Portugal, the UK, and Mexico relating to James Earl Ray's activities before his arrest. The committee is interested in information suggesting Ray was in Lisbon briefly in May 1968. The document outlines the committee's desire to establish a cordial relationship with Portuguese police for assistance, including access to files and interviewing potential witnesses. The Department is seeking embassy suggestions on how to proceed with Blakey, the Committee's counsel and staff director. The document also advises stations to provide embassy support if solicited but to avoid involving station officers in negotiations if possible. If involvement is unavoidable, HQ should be notified. The document expresses the belief that the Committee's efforts to interview police and witnesses would be more appropriately handled by legatts or others who would be publicly quoted or identified.
