This is a memorandum requesting an Industrial Security Approval at the TOP SECRET level for David L. Christ, who retired from the Agency and is now employed by Devenco. The request is based on ORD having a contractual relationship with Devenco, the need for Christ's TOP SECRET clearance to be activated, and the need for SI & TK clearances.
