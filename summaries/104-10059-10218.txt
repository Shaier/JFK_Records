This memorandum summarizes a search for documentation related to the creation of a Special Counterintelligence Operation and a study on "International Connections with the United States Peace Movement," both circa mid-1967. It details requests from Mr. Ober, a former CI/SO Chief, for specific documents he needed for his appearance before the Rockefeller Commission. The memo outlines the documents found, their locations, and the process for Mr. Ober to use and potentially share them with the Commission, requiring clearance and specific permissions. The memo also notes the inability to find certain requested documents.
