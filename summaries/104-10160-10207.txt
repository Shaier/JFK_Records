This document is a contact report detailing a recontact with Oliverio A. TOMEU Vasallo on June 8, 1964. TOMEU provides additional details on Carlos and Ana Gloria de VARONA, and identifies Osiel GONZALEZ and one "COCO" as possible leads to Jose LLANUSA Sobel.

The report discusses TOMEU's recollections of people he met while in hiding, including "COCO," who was described as the secretary to Jose LLANUSA Gobel. He also suggests that Carlos or Ana de VARONA may be able to identify "COCO" and provide data on his accessibility for contact. Catel CORALES, former Chief of the Havana Fire Department, was identified by TOMEU as another possible lead who would know LLANUZA.

TOMEU also provided two snap shots of himself and six other individuals who were in asylum at the same time. He identified those individuals as Manuel VILLAKANAN, Oliverio TOMEU, Nils DIAZ, Publio RUIZ, Jorge Del VALLE, and Osiel GONZALEZ.

TOMEU stated that he would no longer follow any man as individual or as a leader, because a man's ideals, outlook and objectives change with time.
