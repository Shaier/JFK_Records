This is a letter from Richard Helms, Director of the CIA, to Sir Charles C. F. Spry, Director General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization. Helms thanks Spry for his letter recommending against declassifying Warren Commission document CO-971. He notes that the CIA's inquiry to Spry in August 1968 was in anticipation of pressure to release Warren Commission papers, but that pressure hasn't materialized. Helms states that there is no intention to release CO-971 at the present time. He also states that Spry's letter provides reason to keep the document out of the public domain. The letter includes distribution information and mentions a Deputy Director for Plans.
