This document is a Central Intelligence Agency Information Report dated April 22, 1963, concerning indications of the Government of Vietnam's plan to request a reduction of American personnel in Vietnam. It describes tension developing between the Vietnamese and U.S. governments over operations in South Vietnam, specifically citing concerns over "infringements" of Vietnamese sovereignty by the MAAG and U.S. Special Forces. The report suggests Diem plans to confront U.S. representatives with evidence and demand a reduction in U.S. personnel. Additionally, some Vietnamese working closely with Americans were being questioned about U.S. activities and indicated that the U.S. military, particularly the Special Forces, did not seem to coordinate their activities with Vietnamese authorities.
