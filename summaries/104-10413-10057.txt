This document is a memorandum from the Chief of the Domestic Collection Division, Operations Services Group, Alien Branch to the Chief of the Miami Field Office. It concerns Case 57845 and requests assistance in identifying an unidentified man. The man's photograph was published in the Warren Commission report on the assassination of President Kennedy and he is believed to have visited Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City in October 1963.

A former member of the Cuban General Directorate of Intelligence (DGI) identified the man as Yuri (LNU), a KGB officer. Yuri acted as a troubleshooter for a group of Cubans attending an intelligence course in Moscow in 1964. He was a friend of Juan (PSEUDO), a KGB officer who taught the Cubans about the Agency and the West German intelligence apparatus.
