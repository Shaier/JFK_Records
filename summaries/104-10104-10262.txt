This document is a routing and record sheet from the CIA. It concerns information about James Garrison, the District Attorney of Orleans, Louisiana. MI-5, the British Security Service, has reported that Garrison has been in touch with the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation. The initiative appears to have come from the Foundation to persuade Garrison to write an article about the assassination of President Kennedy. MI-5 has also passed this information to the FBI representative in London. The author requests to be advised in advance if any executive action is to be taken based on this information because MI-5's source is very sensitive.
