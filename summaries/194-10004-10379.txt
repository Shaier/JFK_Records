This document is a collection of agent reports from November 18, 1968, compiled by the U.S. Army, specifically the 108th Military Intelligence Group. The reports concern Manuel Marti, who was being assessed for a position of trust and responsibility with the U.S. government. The reports feature interviews with three of Marti's former coworkers at Polly Perry Stores, where he worked as a shipping clerk in 1964 and 1965. The interviewees described Marti in positive terms, generally agreeing that he was a quiet, respectable, intelligent, and cooperative employee. None reported knowing anything adverse about his character, habits, or political views. One interviewee declined to recommend Marti due to insufficient knowledge.
