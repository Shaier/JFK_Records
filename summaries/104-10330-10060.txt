This is a memorandum from the CIA's Historical Review Group to the Assassination Records Review Board concerning the declassification of foreign government information, specifically from Australia, found in the JFK collection. The CIA does not object to the release of the four CIA documents, but is only concerned about protecting foreign government information. It emphasizes the legal obligations to seek consent from foreign governments before declassifying their information. However, seeking consent from the Australians is currently problematic due to recent incidents straining the relationship. The CIA proposes postponing the release of the Australian documents or substituting them with summaries, expressing concern that disregarding these obligations could damage diplomatic and intelligence relationships. The memo also addresses future coordination on foreign government information and the CIA's consent to release its documents with proposed redactions.
