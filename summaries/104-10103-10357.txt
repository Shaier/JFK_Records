This document is a cable about Nicky Szulc, who is still in Madrid as of February 17, 1976. She claims to have been in Cuba three times, most recently during an international women's conference, and that she works as an advisor for the MINREX counter-intelligence section. She says Cubans gave her access to CIA activities and that she receives a salary and a car with a chauffeur. Additionally, Szulc states that she had worked closely with Agee on the preparation of his book, and that they were angry with John Marks for publishing his book "How to Spot a Spook." They believe this will alert the CIA to change its tactics, and consider Marks a traitor. The file number is 73-6-46/3. E2 IMPDET.
