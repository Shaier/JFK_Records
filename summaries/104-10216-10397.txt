This document is a message regarding the case of AMLASH, advising that the case is too extensive to relay but recommends a plan to have Joseph Langosch visit Rome to brief Presland, probably in August. It states there is no definite evidence AMLASH is part of a doubled operation, but the subject is considered insecure. It mentions that involvement is marginal and suggests minimizing contact until Langosch can provide background information, unless Rome has specific operational plans.
