This document discusses the continuation of payment for C/LPAVERT's e-mail account. Action is required to advise if there is interest in renewing C/LPAVERT's CompuServe account. C/LPAVERT had previously asked about renewing his account and had received US$1,700 as an administration fee for the account opened on NWBOLTON's behalf. C/LPAVERT had told IC MACDONALD E. ZAPPLEY that he was convinced NWBOLTON was involved in the assassination of President Kennedy. The account was then deemed not suitable for a sensitive field asset. Station has had no contact with C/LPAVERT since September 1995.
