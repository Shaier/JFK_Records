This classified message from the CIA discusses the risks involved in retrieving equipment from a source. It suggests exploring alternative options, such as inductive tapping, and recommends using non-attributable equipment. The message also asks if Rome has similar equipment to ERT 24 and batteries, and suggests using non-attributable batteries made in France if Rome cannot provide them. The memo also notes a proposal to mount an audio target.
