This document is a secret telecommunication from Brussels to Washington, concerning the unwillingness of an entity identified as "NITRUST" to share information about a Flemish militant group's (VMO) potential contacts with American citizens. The concern stems from the Freedom of Information Act, which NITRUST believes puts the information at risk of being leaked. The sender seeks advice from headquarters on how to counter NITRUST's concerns regarding the protection of liaison sources.
