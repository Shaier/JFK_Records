This document is a cable concerning the House Select Committee on Assassinations' (HSCA) investigation, chaired by Representative Louis Stokes. The HSCA has been interviewing former agency employees and reviewing materials provided by the agency, leading to the identification of nonofficial cover officers and agent cryptonyms. The committee intends to send staff members to various countries to interview individuals in the field, raising concerns about source protection and the identities of nonofficial officers. The agency is working with Chairman Stokes to develop mutually accepted guidelines for handling HSCA requests, including protocols for contacting former agency employees and individuals who may have information relevant to the investigation. The document outlines procedures for handling requests from HSCA staff members to contact nonofficial cover officers and agents.
