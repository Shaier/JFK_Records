This document, dated April 20, 1977, identifies a sensitive source cited in a previous report as an audio operation against the Cuban Embassy in Paris, France. This operation, encrypted under the code name UNSIERRA, is now defunct. The files related to it are stored in archives, and can be retrieved through the French Desk if needed.

The document also mentions a referenced communication, PARI 1664, dated November 27, 1963, located in Rolando CUBELA's official file. A person named Marta FRAYDE, identified in cable UNSNAFU-12, is identified as a Cuban alternate delegate to UNESCO and an unwitting FI source at that time.

Finally, the document notes that a copy of the referenced cable was provided to Mr. Breckinridge for a meeting with Senators Hart and Schweiker on June 11, 1976. The document is an attachment to a memo from Chris Hopkins, LAD/Task Force (JFK).
