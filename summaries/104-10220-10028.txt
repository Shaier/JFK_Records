This document is a collection of intelligence cables, FBI reports, State Department cables, and other internal memos from US government agencies, primarily the CIA and FBI, from the mid-1970s. The subject of the documents is an individual named Rolando Otero Hernández, described as a Cuban exile, potential terrorist, and possibly working with Chilean intelligence. The documents track Otero's movements, activities, and associations, including potential plots to assassinate individuals like Luis Andrés Pascal Allende and discussions about his connection to figures such as Orlando Bosch. The agencies are attempting to gather and disseminate information about Otero, coordinate with each other and foreign governments, and assess the reliability of information sources. Some documents request further investigation, data sharing, and specific actions such as arranging for the legal attaché to be informed, contacting liaison services, and attempting extradition.
