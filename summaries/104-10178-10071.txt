This document is a classified message from the CIA's Luxembourg station, dated May 4, 1959, reporting information about Armand Delacour, also known as Delamare. Delacour is described as a three-time convict from Paris who approached an informant about a narcotics smuggling operation. The message details Delacour's physical characteristics and claims that he can obtain false documentation for American visas. It also alleges that Delacour stated two Sicilians living in Paris were already successfully engaged in similar traffic, receiving opium from Hong Kong, delivered it to the U.S. via Canada. The message indicates that Delacour was released from jail in December 1958 on theft charges and had smuggled narcotics before and after the war from North Africa.
