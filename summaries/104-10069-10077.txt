This document discusses a report received by the LAFO (Los Angeles Field Office) about the yacht Potomac potentially being used by the Alpha 66 organization to transport weapons. The report came from an unsolicited phone call, and the caller mentioned that the vessel was previously used by Theodore Roosevelt. An investigation revealed that the Potomac was once a USCG cutter and later owned by F. D. Roosevelt. It had recently been acquired by a company in Newport Beach. Further investigation revealed that the Potomac was supposed to be brought from Barbados to California by a prosecutor but the prosecutor left as the boat was in bad shape. It had recently turned up in San Diego. The report's source was identified as Assistant US Attorney Bill Spivaky, who had said the Cliff Roberts he had mentioned earlier had come with the vessel from Barbados. The document also notes that the material is sketchy and its credibility is questionable, so no follow-up is planned unless requested.
