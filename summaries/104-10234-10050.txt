This document is a message from the Director to Paris JMWAVE regarding the A-9 individual. It discusses concerns that A-9 may have been captured in the Cardenas Matanzas area, referencing news articles about individuals caught or sought while attempting to land.

The document refers to contacts on a previous trip.
