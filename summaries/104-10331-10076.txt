This document is a memorandum regarding the JFK Review Board's actions on CIA records. It discusses a disagreement between the Director of Central Intelligence and the Deputy Director of Operations regarding the release of certain documents containing the names of CIA employees who retired under cover. The DDO argues that releasing these names could pose a security risk to the individuals and compromise past operations, while the DCI believes that the potential damage does not outweigh the need for disclosure under the JFK Act. The document recommends that the DCI disapprove the DDO's recommendation to appeal the JFK Board's decision to the President. It also includes attachments with the relevant documents and the DDO's argument.
