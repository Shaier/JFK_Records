The document is a collection of memos and talking points from the CIA regarding the protection of the cryptonym "IJDECANTER," a CIA source who was a senior official in the KGB of the former USSR. The CIA argues that releasing this cryptonym in a particular context would provide a benefit to the Russian counterintelligence effort and damage US intelligence interests. They propose substituting a fictitious cryptonym instead. They also express concern for the safety of the source's family still living in Russia.
