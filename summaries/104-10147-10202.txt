This document is an addendum to a journal from the Office of Legislative Counsel, dated July 6, 1978. It details two separate interactions:

1.  A liaison accompanied others to brief a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence staff director about concerns regarding the potential exposure of sensitive information by the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The briefing discussed a strategy involving various chairmen and possibly the President to address these concerns.
2.  A liaison received a call from Senate Select Committee on Intelligence staff requesting contact information for a former Agency employee. The liaison also explained the Agency's position regarding another retired employee's post-retirement work and answered a question about a similar situation involving a former Chief of Station.
