This document discusses intelligence related to a potential uprising in Cuba. The intelligence comes from various sources, but ultimately traces back to a single source. While initially considered accurate, further investigation suggests it may be inaccurate and potentially part of a deception or provocation operation. A collation of intelligence from multiple sources reveals that several groups have supposedly scheduled to participate in the revolt. Inquiries with these groups reveal that they are not aware of the revolt. Balanced judgement indicates that a bona fide popular uprising is unlikely at this time, but a provocation possibility cannot be excluded. Arrangements have been made to broadcast a statement warning Cuban patriots not to undertake an uprising, as this is desired and expected by the Castro communist forces.
