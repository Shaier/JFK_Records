O'BRIEN:
July 11, 1970
Alexandria, Virginia
By Dennis J. O'Brien
For the John F. Kennedy Library
I think a logical place to begin in anything
like this is just simply with the question,
when did you first meet President Kennedy,
or Senator Kennedy, if you met him before
he was President?
LANSDALE: I don't recall meeting him before he was

meeting in the White House by (Robert S.)

early on,
borrowed some military personnel to help with
the planning e earlier but they were people
who had been attached to CIA for temporary
duty on other matters, and they hadn't come
in initially for this specific planning. In
December, when the planning had obviously
started coming in with a beach landing and so
on, the way it turned out, I urged at that
point to get military planning in on the

thing. I was worrying about it. As a matter
of fact, Allen Dulles brought his planners
to a policy meeting, a policy group meeting,

questioning was such that Allen Dulles pleaded

enough concrete and specific information
myself that was separate from theirs. Most
of the intelligence take at the time, avail-

determining the accuracy or inaccuracy of it.

I was apparently causing too much trouble and

O'BRIEN:
Well, do you get involved in the informing
of McNamara and Gilpatric about this? Do you
get any way of sensing what their reactions

does
did the Bay of Pigs have, let's say over in

and in the White House?
:
-18-
LANSDALE:
It was a traumatic experience at top levels throughout
of the government. I think it affected
V
President Kennedy more than any other single
thing. It was almost a taboo subject if you
were going in to do business and to get an
approven something over even hinted
Such
a Juba
Juban affair. It was an
intensefully sore subject among all of these
people. I felt that almost all of the key
executives in the administration must have

during the daytime working hours they just
even
didn't even want to contemplate it. And yet
و
they were honest enough people that they knew
they had to face up and look at it and would do
so, but it was an extremely emotional subject
with them, very much so.
:
O'BRIEN:
Well, in terms of the Agency, there's a number
of programs and, of course, involvements in
operations that they have. Do you see any
shift in these, any attempt on the part of the
Defense Department to move into some of these
areas which they felt were traditionally theirs
-19-
rather than the Agency. I guess what I'm
trying to say is, can you see any decline in
the Agency influence in the Agency in
t
ong
in decisions?
LANSDALE: Yes, I think so. I'm not certain that it was
well
the military as such.
It might have been the

were somewhat interested but wouldn't really

directly asked, and there always had been some

type of
the military about
itl--among
any clandestine, operations. They felt that
:
:
once it got over into guerrilla type of operations
or anything that would involve a military subject,
بو
that it would be far better to let the military
establishment of the U.S. handle it. "But that
K
would be sort of a dinner-coctail party type of
a gambit on their part, rather than sitting and
planning and so on of "We must grab some of
that
this," Even though among themselves they talked
that way. They didn't express "it in terms of
their attendance at policy councils or even in
-20-
talks with people like the Secretary of Defense
or the civilian, executive side of Defense. On
this, I think that McNamara himself probably
well,

military operation and just to be more efficient

such things. I imagine that he talked that way

that the Bay of Pigs and the misreading of the

Do you ever take this question up, or is this

was reiterated enough so that it was known by
a number of people, and I always felt that it was

more efficient and effective to have a very
small group working and to choose them with very

people who were very sensitive on my presence
abroad initially. Since I didn't just stick
in a regular military category but would get
over into their own subject matter, this made
them very uncomfortable and I can understand
it while it happened, but it was carried to
too great an emotional length. At times I
would suggest certain individuals be sent to
look into a situation in a given country and
would arrange their transportation and so ong
and I would get backing throughout the U.S.
government for this things and have an individual

back so that we would get reports back. There
would be times when these individuals would
