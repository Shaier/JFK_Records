Crank Letter Concerning warren Commission
Document
SUBJECT
:
(5)
Our office in Madrid has sent us a copy of the attached
Spanish-language letter addressed to the American Ambassador
to Spain, and signed by one Antilin PERIS, alleging in the
first paragraph that the author has some information of interest
to impart. After opening the second paragraph by saying that he
had to flee Paris due to an indiscretion committed there, the
author states:
"There (apparently Paris), in the home of
some American friends, I got hold of an authen-
tic document about the assassination in Dallas,
which they say was swiped from the Warren
Commission and which is certainly prejudicial
for President Johnson. I have it on good
authority that they are currently trying to sell
it to no less than the Director of "Paris-Match."
Someone from the Embassy of the United Kingdom
in Paris is involved in the matter."...
France
Spain
The author closes by suggesting that an advertisement be inserted
in a Madrid newspaper if there be any interest in further details.
[s]
There are no traces from Madrid on Antilin PERIS, which
according to CAS, Madrid is almost certainly an alias. NeedlessLS
to say there is no return address on the letter for envelope, which
was mailed from Barcelona on 26 September 1964. CAS, Madrid has
forwarded us a copy of the letter on the off chance that we may
have received similar allegations; in such case Madrid would (s)
appreciate learning the details so that they might inform the
Embassy. It was also suggested that we show you this letter.
