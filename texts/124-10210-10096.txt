"On 23 May 1974 we asked a high-level source

The Department of Immigration is under the CC]
Secretariat of Gobernacion, soi so it was believed that
(they might have some information on GIANCANA. We
never received a reply to this request. In July
1974, however, our contact within Gobernacion told [C]
us that the Government of Mexico (GOM) was expelling
GIANCANA from the country, to the United States,
within 24 hours
(৫)
"In meetings held with our contact on 23 August,
28 September, and 1 October 1974, we brought up the
subject of GIANCANA., The contract said that the
local immigration authorities had been seeking
GIANCANA because he was in the country illegally.
They finally located him in July, arrested him on
the spot, and deported him the following day.
expulsion was not carried out on the basis of any
specific information supplied by the US Embassy, nor
.were there any indications that he was engaged in
any criminal activity here. Rather it was an
internal GOM decision to expel an unwanted alien
who was living illegally in Mexico

He stated he did not believe that he had indicated in any
manner to GUTIERREZ BARRIOS that the embassy thought subject (C)
was involved in narcotics activities in Mexico. He did
mentioned the possibility that because of emphasis being
placed on narcotics by both governments, high Mexican officials
might have reached the decision that subject should be ex-
