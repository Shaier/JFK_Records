The Chairman. The hearing will come to order.
2
I would like to ask Mr. Schwarz if he would give us a
1

brief synopsis of what we intend to question our witness
about this morning.
5
6
Mr. Schwarz. The witness this morning will only be a
single witness. He is Mr. Samuel Halpern.
He was in the

9
10
Far East, and I have now found out he was involved in the
Sukarno moving and some alleged killing of an agent in
Tailand, which are collateral matters that we may want to
take up with him at the end.
11
12
13
But he came back here in the fall of 1961 and was in-
structed as assistant to get into the Cuban matter. And
he will testify that he was told that they would proceed
14
to overthrow the Castro government, and that there were no

holds barred.
He will then describe the way in whch they worked
with the Special Group.
The Chairman. What was Halpern's position?
Mr. Schwarz. Halpern's position was as Executive
Assistant to Harvey. And Harvey, you will remember, was the
man that was actually in charge of the Cuban position.
The Chairman. When are we going to get Harvey?
Mr. Schwarz.
23
He is coming next Wednesday morning.
24
We are going to get some of this same conflict between

Who else was present at that meeting?
3
Mr. Halpern. A Mr. Ghose Zogbey. He was my branch

chief.
5
Mr. Schwarz. Is he alive today, or is he dead?
6
Mr. Halpern. He died last year.

7
Mr. Schwarz.
Approximately when in the fall of 1961
8
did that meeting take place?
9
10
11
Mr. Halpern. About the middle of October 1961.
Mr. Schwarz. What instructions were you given by Mr.
Bissell at tht meeting?
Mr. Halpern. Mr. Bissell said he had recently and

been chewed out in the Cabinet Room of the White House by

it, sitting on his ass and not doing anything about getting
rid of Castro and the Castro regime. His orders to both
Mr. Zogbey) and to me were to plan for an operation to
accomplish that end.
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003

21
Mr. Schwarz. Was any content put into the term
"get rid of", or was that the term that was used, and only
that term?
22
23
24
25
Mr. Halpern. To the best of my recollection, that was
it. There was no limitation of any kind. Nothing was for-
bidden, and nothing was withheld. And the objective was to

remove Castro and his regime.
2
Mr. Schwarz. And did you talk about tactics at all
3 in that meeting, or was it just a general discussion about
getting organized.
4
9
5
6
Mr. Halpern. Just a general discussion as to what we would
do, how we would proceed, and what we would need. And at
7
8
9
that point I had no idea how many people were left on the staff
in the branch only having been on the job a day or a day and
a half.
10
11
Mr. Schwarz. Shorly after that time did you get put in
contact with a general?
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
Mr. Halpern. Yes, sir. General Lansdale.
Mr. Schwarz. And what was his function when you were
introduced to him?
Mr. Halpern. Both Mr. Zogbey and I were introduced
to him as the new chief of Operations for a government-wide
effort to accomplish the removal of Castro and the Castro
regime. This effort was to include not only CIA but the
Department of State and the Department of Defense. And
General Lansdale was to be the Chief of Operations for that
outfit.

22
Mr. Schwarz. And did you brief him about Cuba or did
23
24
he brief you about the operation, or what was the nature of that?
Mr. Halpern. No, we briefed him first in the old
25
Situation Room, what used to called the Ibell Building, which

Mr. Halpern. It wasn't a matter of General Lansdale's
being in charge, or the Attorney General being in charge,
nobody objected to General Lansdale reporting to the Attorney
4
General.
5

7
It was a matter of whether this would be done through
the normal chain of command, or whether we would actually be
under the General's direct command.
8
Mr. Schwarz. But it still is a chracterization, you
9
were dealing with organization and bureaucracy?
10
Mr. Halpern. That is right. And drafting papers.
11
Mr. Schwarz. Drafting papers to do what?
12
Mr. Halpern. To try to get organized in terms of how
WARD & PAUL
13
we would accomplish the objective.
14
Mr. Schwarz. Did any of those papers that you drafted
15
in those early stages include any reference to assassination
16
as a device to accomplish the objective?
17
Mr. Halpern. No, sir.
18
Mr. Schwarz. Now, did Mr. Helms
enter the picture in
19
the latter part of December 1961?
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
20
Mr. Halpern. That is correct.
Mr. Schwarz. Describe how he came into the picture.
21
22
Mr. Halpern. To my knowledge, Mr. Zogbey described to
23
24
me a meeting he had been at at the Director's morning staff
meeting this is Mr. McCone's morning staff meeting
which Mr. McCone, almost in terms of a bombshell for the

be the words were, his man on Cuba. This was something
that nobody in the room apparently had any inkling of, and
particularly Mr.Helms, nor Mr Zogbey.
The Chairman. May I ask you to repeat that?
I am sorry, I just didn't catch it.
Mr. Halpern. At a meeting sometime in December 1961,
which was the morning staff meeting that the Director held, and

Mro Zogbey) was present

10
11
Mr. Schwarz. But you were not?
Mr. Halprrn I was not, I got this from Mr.Zogby
12
13
14
15
the Director, Mr. McCone, announced that Mr. Helms would be
his man on Cuba, Mr. Helms would then be the Chief of Operations
for the Deputy Director of Plans, and Mr. Bissell was in the
room as the DDP.
16
Mr. Helms had no inkling of this before the meeting,
17
18
and so stated to (Mr.Zogbey, and even asked Mr. Zogby if he had
had any inkling before the meeting.
19
20
Mr Zogbey told me that he had none whatsoever.
Mr. Schwarz. Did Mr. Helms then come and visit your
21
new organization and tell you to make some changes?
22
Mr. Halpern. Yes. He came to Mr. Zogbey's office and looked
23
at the list of officers, male and female, who were still
24
working in the branch. Most of them were the remnants of the
25
TOP SECRET
people from the old Bay of Pigs operation who had not yet been
reassigned.

Mr. Schwarz. There was no such previous evidence.
Mr. Halpern. We had a number of female officers, and
still do, in our branches. And there were some in the Cuban
branch and the Cuban task force.

Senator Huddleston. Can you name one or suggest one
that was heavily involved in the assassination attempt?
Mr. Halpern. Oh, I don't know of any in the assassina-
tion attempt per se.
Senator Huddleston. You don't know of any?
Mr. Halpern. No, sir.
Senator Huddleston. Thank you.
The Chairman. Senator Mondale?
Senator Mondale. I am sorry I came in late, Mr. Hal-

were saying that orders came from somewhere to get off your

Mr. Smothers. Was it your understanding that these

Mr. Halpern.
That word was not used, sir.
But no

Mr. Smothers. Let me ask you it another way. What was
your understanding of what Mr. Bissell had been told to do
9
by the President and the Attorney General?
10
Mr. Halpern. To get rid of Castro and the Castro regime
11
on the Island of Cuba.
12

Mr. Smothers. Did Mr. Bissell convey to you the idea

that that included killing Castro?

went back one thing we both agreed on, both Zogbey and
I, is that we were not going to come up with a piece of
paper which said this was going to be easy or could be done
overnight, or could be done with mirrors.
23
The Chairman. Did you come away after your conversation
24
with Mr. Bissell with the idea that he had instructed you
25
to come up with a plan of some kind designed to overthrow,

The Chairman. I would like to take this and several
other questions up with the committee, one of which deals
with the question of the August recess. And I want to
confer with you on that, too.
How many more questions do you have?
Mr. Schwarz. Instead of asking the other questions I will
ask whether he knows anything about them, and we could bring
him back later if he does.
Do you know anything about the film made in order
#to discredit Mr. Sukarno by showing immoral activity on his
part?
13
Mr. Halpern. Yes, sir.
14
Mr. Schwarz. We will bring you back on that.
15
The Chairman.
Can we get that done now?
16
Mr. Schwarz. Such a film was made sin Hollywood, was it?
17
Mr. Halpern. I don't know where it was made, sir,
18
but I know it was made.
19
Mr. Schwarz. It was made in the U.S.?
20
Mr. Halpern. As far as I know it was.
21
Mr. Schwarz. And was that done under your direction?
22
Mr. Halpern. Well, it was done at the Far East Division
23
24
request, and I was the one who did the negotiating with the
Office of Security.
25
Mr. Schwarz. And was the plan that a film would show!

sexual activity with some female, and that then the film
would be released in Indonesia, and it would be attributed to
the Russians in some fashion?
Mr. Halpern. No, sir, that was not the plan at all.
Mr. Schwarz.
What was the plan?
7
Mr. Halpern.
The plan was to have such a film from

10
11
which we could make film which we could use in the propaganda
activity against Sukarno in terms of him being close to the
Russians, because the woman was supposed to be the Russian
blonde woman that was assigned to Mr. Sukarno as escort

officer when he visited the Soviet Union, and then went back
and stayed with him for some time in Indonesia
14
Mr. Schwarz.
In short, it was a fake movie which was
15
16
designed to put Mr. Sukarno in an undesirable light, by
showing that he was having relations with some Russian
female?
17
18
19
Mr. Halpern. And, therefore, in Russian control.
Senator Mondale. How was that film supposed to get to
20
Indonesia?
21
Mr. Halpern. It wasn't a film.
The original plan was
22
23
to use clips from it in propaganda leaflets, and pamphlets,
and things like that, just picture sufrom the film.
24
Mr. Schwarz. Who authorized that?
25
Mr. Halpern. Mr. Ulmer, who was then Division Chief.
