Operation dated 27 and 28 July, 1, 3 (two reports), 5 and 9 August 1967
(two reports). One of the reports dated 3-August is a monthly resume of
operational activities for the month of July. It is forwarded together with
the other reports rather the separately to give as complete a picture as
possible of LIRING-3's dealings with Hoises OROZCO Leal, the circumstances
in which the two men met and the reporting of these dealings by LIRING-3
to ROWTON. Forwarded as Attachment Ivo, also under separate cover, are
photo copies of a two page typewritten message left by OROZCO at LIKING-3's
epartment on 1 August. Another copy of this message is being forwarded
Guatemala City seperately.

2. There is little question that LIRING-3 seized the opportunity given
him by the sudden apperition of OROZCO on the scene to cover vis a vis his
wife a few days of nisbehaving. Instead of proceeding to Tapachuls to receive
from the FAR new contract instructions in Mexico City (an awkward arrangement
to say the least), LIRING-3 remained at the safe house he uses in the capital
to receive the visit (as indicated by LIFEAT) of Berta WICISSER his "regular"
mistress, Silvia DURAN (of Lee Earvey OSWALD fame) and possibly a certain
Yolanda (who appears for the first time in this operation and whose phone
number is not in the Station reversed Hexico City telephone directory)
Pinned down on the fact that he was in Mexico. City during the period of 19
to 21 July, LIRING-3 admitted that he was but felt that he had to tell
another lie racher than admit his misbehavior. This lie was that he did not
want to appear dependant on Sergio VALDEZ in the eyes of ROWTON and so
wade his first meeting with OROZCO "more intriguing" by inventing the trip
to Tapachula. To add credence to the Tapachula story, LIRING-3 previously
asked his wife to impress ROWTON with her concern for his, telling ROWTON
that he had disappeared for three days without telling her where he went.
This she did very convincingly with much sobbing and crying. The LIROSIN
LP which continues to experience technical difficulties now and then did not
operate properly that day (it's recorder broke down) but, as luck will have
it LIROSIN live monitored conversation between LIKING-3 and his wife
during which the latter reported that her tears seemed to have convinced
Buntham and on what one had onme retry hint talk with
LIRING-3 coacerned the mention of the alias which ROWTON uses with LIRING-3
and 4 to various persons with whom LIRING-3 is in touch. LIFEAT coverage
had indicated, for example, that LIRDNG-3 mentioned BOSTON in alias to
Sergio VALDEZ. This LIRING-3 denied. He produced on 3 August 1967 a
written review of all the people of interest to ROWTON with whom he has
been in contact indicating whether or not he mentioned ROWTON's alias to
them. This review is attached to one of ROWTON's reports dated 9 August.

3. What happened between OROZCO, LIRING-3, Sergio VALDEZ and Raul
MORENO is explained in detail in ROWTOH's reports forwarded with this
dispatch. A few additional points should probably be made here. First of
all, part of the first meeting between LIRING-3 and ORCZCO at LIRING_3's
sefehouse was live monitored by LIROSIN when the latter returned home from
his regular bartending job in the early hours of the morning. LIROSIN
heard enough (his recorder was once more inoperative) to basically confira
LIRING-3's report of his meeting with OROZCO to ROWTON. Secondly, neither
VALDEZ nor MORENO were present during the night of 31 July1 August when
LIRING-3 told OROZCO that the latter vas in fact a deserter from the FAR,
refusing to indicate how he knew this (ROWTON had passed LIRING-3 information
on OROZCO received by the Station from both LIREBEL-1 and 2). The two men
arrived at LIRING-3's apartment in the early morning hours when OROZCO
had admitted everything and thus do not know what prompted him to tell the
truth. Thirdly, LURING-3 nsists that he told OROZCO nothing about his
plastic flower business and it's contemplated use to cover activities in
support of the Guatemalan rebels. According to him, CROZCO already knew
this as well as other details of his dealings with the FAR. LIRING-3
presumes that OROZCO learned this from the higher-ups of the FAR guerrillas
while in the hills. OROZCO mistakenly apparently thought that LIRING-3 was
in the actual arms procurement business whereas his discussions with the
FAR have been limited up to now to the eventual transportation of FAR
acquired supplies from Northern Mexico to Guatemala (with the FAR assuming
the responsibility of smuggling these supplies over the Guatemalan border).
LIRING-3's plastic flower business designed to cover support activities on
behalf of the FAR, is not, as a matter of fact operative yet. Thus OROZCO
was badly informed of LIRING-3's activities. How OROZCO hoped to obtain arms
from LIRING-3, had the latter been able to deliver some at the Guatemalan
border area, in view of the fact (as he later admitted) that he was stone
broke, is a matter of conjecture. A desperate man may do desperate things
and LIRING-3 could have found himself in serious trouble. Judging from the
FAR's shooting habits it is a good thing in any case that OROZCO was not
armed during the argument at LIRING-3's apartment the sight of 31 July to
1 August, particularly when VALDEZ started to threaten him,

4. This Station believes that the LIRING-3 Operation has reached a
critical point as a result of the OROZCO affair. Both the Cubans and the
FAR (via Ernesto CAPUANO Del Vecchio) have beenotified by LIRING-3 of
OROZCO's conduct and statements (a copy of OROZCO ssage forwarded as
Attachment Two was given CAPUANO). If the FAR is at all interested in
LIRING-3 he will somehow hear from the Gustesalan guerrillas and negociacions
concerning arms and equipment will he rearmed. LIPING-3 has not heard from
GARCIA since Jume and does not even know if the latter is in Mexico.
It is the Station's opinion that he probably will hear nothing directly
from the Cubans.

5. Headquarters will note, per ROWTOH's report dated 28 July, the
relative case with which LIRIFG-3 claims to be obtaining a false passport
and other identity papers. The Cuban's passports that LIRING-3 purchased
in Nuevo Laredo, mentioned in the same report, vere issued in 1953 and 1959
and may be of marginal value. They will nevertheless be forwarded to
Headquarters together with other documentation held by the bearers of these
passports.
