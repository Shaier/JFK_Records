The purpose of this memorandum is to summarize investigative

Director Sec'y

Document Section, FBI Laboratory, determined the type appearing
on Hoover memorandum dated 8/25/36 was prepared on a Remington typewriter
with an elite type used since October, 1935. Hoover memorandum to Tamm dated
9/10/36, was prepared on an IBM typewriter with pica-style type used since 1930.

The letterhead used on both Hoover memoranda of 8/24-25/36 was
authorized FBI stationery effective August 14, 1936.

On 3/10/75, Mr. Donald B. Schewe, Assistant Librarian, Reference
Archives, Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, Hyde Park, New York, advised that
The White House Ushers Appointment Book contained entries showing that
on Thursday, August 24, 1936, from 9:20 a.m. to 10:12 a.m., President
Roosevelt met with Mr. Hoover in his residence at The White House prior to
leaving for his office. Schewe pointed out that this meeting was significant
since President Roosevelt met Mr. Hoover immediately after returning from
an extended trip, a departure from his usual practice. There was no entry
on 8/25/36, other than the President's departure for the Dakotas at 10:40 p.m.

On 4/2/75, review of Cordell Hull Papers, Library of Congress,
reflected that a Desk Diary (container #68, folder #295, microfilm #38) of
Secretary Hull contained an entry on 8/25/36 that the Secretary had luncheon
with the President between 1:00p.m. to 3:15 p.m.
Detailed memorandum attached.

CONFIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM BY
February 27, 1975
JOHN EDGAR HOOVER DATED AUGUST 25, 1936.

On this date, SA Alonzo L. Lacey of the Intelligence
Division delivered the above-captioned memoranda to the Laboratory
with a request to determine the make of typewriter employed in
the preparation of the memoranda and the date of introduction
of the type styles employed. The purpose of this investigation
was to ascertain whether or not the type styles on the typewriters
used to write the memoranda were in use on the dates appearing
on the memoranda.

It was determined that the "Memorandum For Mr. Tamm
from John Edgar Hoover dated September 10, 1936" was prepared
on an IBM typewriter equipped with a pica style of type which
has been in use since 1930. The typewriting comprising the
"Confidential Memorandum by John Edgar Hoover dated August 25,
1936" was determined to have been prepared on a Remington
typewriter equipped with an elite style of type that has been in
use since October, 1935.

RESEARCH CONDUCTED AT FRANKLIN D.
ROOSEVELT LIBRARY, HYDE PARK, NY
ON 3/10-12/75

On 3/10/74, Mr. DONALD B. SCHEWE, Assistant
Librarian in the Reference Archives, Franklin D. Roosevelt
Library, Hyde Park, NY, was advised of our interest in
locating any communications bearing upon a conversation.
between former President FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT and former
Secretary of State CORDELL HULL in the latter part of
August, 1936. Mr. SCHEWE was advised that this conversation
was concerned with the security of the US and that Mr. J.
EDGAR HOOVER of the FBI may have participated in this
conversation. Mr. SCHEWE was also advised that Mr. ROOSEVELT
allegedly reduced the subject matter of above conversation
to a memorandum and that we were interested in locating.
this memorandum or some information bearing upon above
conversation. Arrangements were made to meet with Mr. SCHEWE
at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, NY,
on 3/12/75. Mr. SCHEWE indicated that in the meantime
he would conduct some research in this matter.
L

On 3/12/75, Mr. SCHEWE advised that he had
conducted some research relative to our telephone call
on 3/10/75, and inquired if we could be more specific
with regard to the dates of the information desired.
"SCHEWE was advised that to the best of our knowledge the
conversation we were interested in involving FRANKLIN D.
ROOSEVELT (FDR), HULL and Mr. HOOVER, occurred on
approximately 8/24-26/36 and that the conversation concerned
the internal security of the US.
:
::
Mr. SCHEWE, at this point, furnished a Xerox
copy of a "buck slip" dated 8/24/36, (copy of which is
attached) on White House stationery, classified "Confidential
and addressed to the Secretary of State from FDR".
Mr. SCHEWE stated that "buck slips" are nothing more
than a cover memorandum utilized to transmit communications
which are attached thereto. It is to be noted that this
"buck slip" indicates that attached to it was a memorandum
for the Secretary of State, unsigned, undated and
recommending coordination of activities of all agents
of the Government in foreign countries. SCHEWE advised

that the synopsis of this memorandum which appears on.
the "buck slip" was the usual practice at that time to
identify the documents attached to it. SCHEWE added.
that this was the only document he was able to locate
which may have some bearing on the desired information.
SCHEWE stated that the possibility exists that the
referred to memorandum may be located among the collection
of papers of CORDELL HULL which are now stored at the
Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.

Mr. SCHEWE then exhibited to interviewing personnel
the White House Ushers Appointment Book which was
hand-written and kept on a daily basis. This appointment
book contained the following pertinent information:

Thursday, August 13, 1936, at 9:50 AM
FDR departed the White House for a visit
to the flood areas in NY, Ohio and Pennsyl-
vania.

Thursday, August 24, 1936, FDR returned
to White House at 8:45 AM.
9:20 AM FDR met with Mr. HOOVER from
9:20 AM to 10:12 AM.
-
(Note *
There is no entry in this book
for Aug. 24, 1936, indicating that Mr.
HULL was there. Mr. SCHEWE advised that
it is interesting to note that. FDR met
Mr. HOOVER in his residence in the White
House on 8/24/36, prior to leaving for
his office in the White House. SCHEWE
also pointed out that this meeting was
significant since FDR met with Mr. HOOVER
on 8/24/36, immediately after returning
from an extended trip. This, according
to SCHEWE was a departure from FDR's
usual practice.

There was no record in the White House
Usher's Appointment Book for 8/25/36, which would indicate
that FDR met with either Mr. HULL or Mr. HOOVER on that
date. This book indicates that FDR departed the White
House on Tuesday, 8,/25/75, at 10:40 PM for a trip to the
draught areas, in upper Maine, South Dakota and North

Dakota, as well as a visit to Mt. Rushmore. FDR did not
return to the White House until Sunday, Sept. 6, 1936,
at 10:02 AM.

The White House Usher's Appointment Book
further reflects that FDR, during the period July 10,
1936, to Aug. 10, 1936, was away from the White House
campaigning. FDR returned to the White House on
8/10/36, and remained there until 8/13/36, when he
again departed on a trip and returned on 8/24/36.
FDR also departed from the White House on 8/25/36,
and returned on 9/6/36.

Mr. SCHEWE also produced to interviewing
personnel the appointment book of FDR's private secretary,
GRACE TULLY for the pertinent period. This appointment book
reflects all of FDR's office appointments.
A review
of this appointment book fails to reflect that FDR met
or had an appointment with Mr. HOOVER in his office
during the period 8/13/36 to 9/6/36. However, this
appointment book does reflect that during this period
FDR did have a meeting with CORDELL HULL on 8/25/36,
at 1:00 PM.
:
Mr. SCHEWE further advised that he personally
reviewed the following and was unable to locate any
documents or references which could possibly shed some
light on the matter of interest to us:
1.) Papers kept in FDR's safe.
..
2.) Papers kept by his secretary in a separate
White House safe.
3.) Papers kept in FDR's official presidential
file.
4.) Papers kept in FDR's alphabetical file
maintained by his secretary..
5.) Individual agencies filės.
6.) J. EDGAR HOOVER'S file.

7.) Attorney General's file.

8.) Assistant Attorney General's file.

9.) National Security file.

10.) Internal Security file.

11.) FBI file.

In conclusion, Mr.SCHEWE stated that after
reviewing all of the above data, he concluded that the
pertinent document of interest to us is not at the FDR
Library at Hyde Park, NY. SCHEWE added that if any
such document is at the Library, it is misfiled and
as there are approximately 21 million pages of manuscripts
and documents at the Library, it would be impossible
to locate same.
:

It is to be noted that on the enclosed
"buck slip" there are four penciled notations, i.e.
285-C, X20, X285 and X67. SCHEWE stated that these
notaions are part of the FDR Library cross-reference
system. SCHEWE added that he checked these references
and could locate nothing further regarding the matter
of interest to us. SCHEWE stated that these references
pertained to the enclosed "buck slip".

On 2/6/75 Mr. Kelley and I met with Senator Church
and Bill Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee.
Senator Church pointed out that he intended to run the Committee in
a very responsible manner, had no intention of destroying or impairing
the effectiveness of the intelligence community and, in fact, hoped that
the efforts of the Committee would help to reestablish public confidence
in the intelligence agencies.

Parameters have not been drawn but Senator Church feels that
the Committee will confine its activities largely to inquiries into domestic
activities. The inquiries will be designed to determine whether agencies
have acted outside the law and the type of remedial legislation necessary
to prevent such abuses in the future.

Study will be largely concerned with the activities of the Central
Intelligence Agency but will, of course, involve the FBI and other agencies
involved in domestic 'intelligence.

The Committee hopes to have a nonpartisan staff of approximately
40 employees headed up by Mr. Miller and would appreciate having necessary
background investigations expedited to permit an early clearance. Miller
indicated he has already been in touch with Mr. Hotis and Mr. Bowers in
this regard. It was explained that the contemplated procedure involved the
FBI conducting the full-field investigation necessary with the results being
furnished to the Chairman, after which he would, upon being personally
satisfied as to their loyalty, furnish the results to CIA for final clearance.
Senator Church appeared satisfied with this arrangement. He stated that
he wanted to prevent leaks and be hopefully as successful as the Judiciary
Committee was on the impeachment inquiry. Our experience in this regard
was pointed out wherein the Judiciary Committee in connection with the 17
wiretaps had written us us a letter indicating that if we made classified

information available they would afford it appropriate security restricted
to members only, excluding staff, and would not make the information
public. Subsequent to the hearings, the Committee published its report
which contained our classified documents right along with the Top Secret
classifications. Senator Church was not aware of this, appeared surprised
by it, and stated surely the information must have been declassified. I
advised him that not by us and it was our information.

Senator Church was asked whether in his opinion the formation
of the Select Committee would have any effect on the proliferation of
committees seeking to obtain testimony from the FBI and it was his opinion
that this would have a favorable effect. He said he had been in touch with
other members of the Senate who felt that it was a waste of time to have
repetitious testimony on the same subject matter before a variety of
committees and he had the feeling that the other committees would hold off
until after the Senate Select Committee completed its hearings. He indicated
that he could not vouch for what would happen in the House, however, he
intended to speak to the House leadership in order to try to effect some
coordinated approach there also, because he was well aware of the large
number of committees seeking to provide oversight or obtain information
from the intelligence agencies.

A question arose as to the extent of cooperation with the Committee
and Senator Church was assured that the FBI would be completely responsive
subject to certain limitations which would have to be delineated by the
President in order to protect sensitive sources and information. Senator
Church indicated that he was going to talk to the President in this regard in
order to secure his complete cooperation, and it was Senator Church's feeling
that the Committee should be entitled to answers to any questions they might
ask without restriction other than, of course, the identities of informants.
He felt the progress of the Committee would be severely impaired if it were
necessary to go to Court over such questions to obtain enforcement of their
right to have access to whatever information they need.
