At 2:30 p.m. on June 2, 1975, a conference was held
with the Deputy Attorney General attended by K. William O'Connor,
Kevin Maroney, Philip White, and Robert McDermott of the Department.
Bureau representatives were Mr. Callahan, Mr. Adams, Mr. Wannall and me.
Mr. O'Connor discussed the request by the Senate Select
Committee for access to the 39 page report by former Assistant Attorney
General Petersen concerning COINTELPRO. Though objections were
presented by the Bureau representatives that the report should not be
furnished to the Committee, and its enclosures, particularly the legal
memoranda should not be made available, the Deputy Attorney General
decided and instructed that the 39 page report should be made available
to John Elliff on Tuesday, June 3, 1975, for his review, at which time he
would be permitted to take notes, but he would not be furnished a copy of
the document. The Deputy further instructed that should Mr. Elliff reques
the attachments to the report, Mr. O'Connor should offer as an alternative
the memoranda which initiated each of the COINTELPROS.

Upon our return to the Bureau, Mr. Adams requested that the
Intelligence Division undertake an analysis of each of the summaries which
were attached to the Petersen report in order to make a damage assessment
based on factors that would affect current Bureau operations should they be
revealed to the Committee. He also requested that this information be
compiled and available to brief the Deputy Attorney General as to the
difficulties that would be involved upon disclosure. T JUN 101975,

Reference is made to your letter dated April 9,
1975, enclosing a resolution adopted by the State Bar of
California condemning the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) for placing an informant on the staff of a legal
service agency to communicate information learned in that
capacity to the FBI and our response dated April 28, 1975.
Contact with the State Bar of California has
enabled us to identify the situation to which they were
referring.
*
Between April, 1968, and November, 1968, one
Rudolph Leamer Muse was operated as an informant by our
New Orleans, Louisiana, Division. Muse furnished information
regarding black extremist activities and he was paid for
services rendered. Muse was unemployed when initially
volunteering his assistance to the FBI and subsequently, on
May 10, 1968, began working as an investigator for the
New Orleans Legal Assistance Corps (NOLAC), an organization
funded by the Office of Economic Opportunity.
Information in the files of our New Orleans Division
indicates during June, 1968, Euse advised it had become
necessary to tell his supervisor at NOLAC of his relationship
with the FBI. His supervisor became aware of Muse's assoc-
iation with black nationalist groups and attempted to discharge
him. To avoid discharge, Muse told his supervisor he was
cooperating with the FBI. Subsequently Muse's supervisor
from NOLAC contacted the New Orleans Division and advised
he wanted to assure the FBI that the relationshi

Muse and the FBI would be maintained by him and would go
no further. Muse's supervisor said he was cognizant of
the importance of Muse's cooperation with the FBI remaining
confidential.
The New Orleans Division of the FBI never
conducted any investigation regarding NOLAC and Muse
never furnished information concerning its activities.
I hope this information will clarify the issue
for you. If I may be of further assistance in this matter,
please contact me.
A copy of this letter is being provided to the
State Bar of California.

NOTE:
}
The resolution of the State Bar of California (SBC)
referred to above did not identify the specific incident in
which they were interested so Congressman Wiggins' letter was
acknowledged and we indicated additional details would follow.
On 4/25/75 San Francisco advised the basis for the SBC resolution
was articles contained in the 2/7/75 issues of the San Francisco
Examiner and Oakland Tribune. In these articles Muse was not
mentioned by name but the details corresponded with his case.
On 4/28/75 Supervisor Ernest Wall, New Orleans, advised Muse
was identified by name in articles concerning this incident
in the 2/2/75 issue of the New Orleans Times Picayune and the
2/25/75 issue of the New Orleans States Item. Since Muse
revealed his relationship with the FBI and has been publicly
identified by name and appears to be no privacy issue or need
to protect the confidentiality of our files, Congressman Wiggins
should be advised of the complete details in this matter. As'
the SBC urged issues such as this be considered by the select
committees of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, a
