BY THE STATEMENT THAT PERSPECTIVE OF THE PARTY WAS GOOD. HE SAID THESE ARTISTS HAD
HAD WRONG ATTITUDES, IN FACT, AND "RECKLESS" IMITATION OF THE SO-CALLED
ARCHITECTURAL THEORIES. HE GENERALLY DEBOROUNCED THAT WAS A NATIONAL TRAITOR
FOR DEGENERATION. HE SAID "I WAS CONCERNED. I HAVE NO QUARREL WITH THE PARTY.
I WAS SURE I WAS BEING SUPPRESSED TO CRITICISM BECAUSE MY ARCHITECTURAL THINKING
DID NOT FIT INTO THE NATIONAL CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM. MY FAILING WAS AS DEEP AS
THAT OF A CHILD BEING BURNED BY ITS MOTHER," SAID, BECAUSE I CRITICIZED OUR
PARTY AS MUCH AS I HAD STRAIGHTED MY CLOTHES. THE PARTY, HOWEVER, WAS VERY PATIENT
WITH ME. AFTER I HAD THOROUGHLY OUT MY SENTIMENTS, I ACHIEVED MY AWAKENING.--"
HE SAID: "I WAS A PRODIGAL SON. AFTER SELF EXAMINATION, I WILL NEVER LEAVE OUR
PARTY NOR EVEN A STEP AWAY FROM IT."
