mentioned examinations, and I hereby affirm that my testimony
therein is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

I was told that somewhere within the overall political
and psychological staff there was located a man with a small
office.
This man's name was Pash, Colonel Boris Pash, and
my understanding was that Colonel Pash had been doing business,
let us say, with the Agency in West Germany for quite a while.
I sought out Colonel Pash. I was directed to his office
and found sitting with him another Agency officer named Artie
Lazarus I'm not sure whether it is Arthur, Lazarus.
Mr. Baron. It's a Greek name. Aristides is his correct
first name, but he goes by Atilo.
Mr. Hunt. Very good. But in any case, he was known
throughout my career as stie Lazarus. And I was at that
point on, let's say, a search mission to determine whether the
alleged capability of Colonel Pash in wet affairs, which is
how it was referred to, that is liquidations, would have any
relevance to our particular problem of the Albanian dis-
appointments.
Mr. Baron. By liquidations, you mean assassinations?
Mr. Hunt. Assassinations. Assassinations, kidnappings,
removals, let's say.
This had been alleged to me. So I spoke to Colonel Pash
in Mr.Lazaruses presence. I explained the problem to him,
although at that juncture I'm quite sure that we had not
identified the Albanian suspect. So we were talking hypothetically

was a rather jesting one, and the impression I gained was
here were a couple of men who were drawing salaries and doing
very little.
And so when Colonel Pash seemed reluctant to become
involved in responding affirmatively to my questions, my
inference was that Colonel Pash and Lazarus could well not
have such a capability but for purposes of employment and
status, this was the job they had. But they didn't want
anyone to call upon them to activate their particular
abilities.
Now that was my impression, and I was a little disgusted
by it. I think I talked to the Chief of the PP staff later,
who was of course well aware of the Albanian problem and I
said I didn't get any satisfaction from Pash, but it doesn't
really make any difference because we don't have the name
of the suspected individual.

21
Mr. Baron. Just to stop here for a second and clear up
some of these details, were you under the impression that what
you called wet affairs, assassinations, kidnappings, or other
removals from the scene of troublesome individuals was the
22
23
primary function of this unit that Pash and Lazarus were
running?
24
Mr. Hunt. Yes.
In fact the only. As far as I knew, they

If they had another function, I was

Do you know anything about Colonel Pash's background?
Mr. Baron. I know a bit, but if you think that there are
relevant details to put on the background, go ahead.

Mr. Hunt. Well, I had not thought of Colonel Pash for
years until I began reading a book called "Lawrence and Oppen-

had known previously that he had been associated during the
war with the Manhattan Project and that he had a security
background. And as I believe I touched on briefly before, it
11
WARD & PAUL
12

was my impression that Pash had been active a couple of years
at least before I knew him in West Germany with the sort of
thing that we had been discussing so far today.
15
Mr. Baron. What kinds of stories had you heard about
Pash's previous activities?
16
Mr. Hunt.
Kidnappings mostly.
17
Mr. Baron.
And where were those?
18

Mr. Hunt.
West Germany and West Berlin.
19
Mr. Baron.
Do you know the names of any of the victims
20
of the kidnapping or any of the people involved other than
21
Pash and Lazarus?
22
Mr. Hunt. I do not.
23
Mr. Baron. And are you aware from whatever source of
24
any assassination planning or attempts that Pash was involved

in?

Mr. Hunt. I am not.
5
Mr. Baron.
Does your answer include not only the period
4
of time before you talked with Colonel Pash but after you
talked with Colonel Pash?
5
6
Mr. Hunt. Yes, sir.
7
I might add that I was rather briefly at CIA headquarters
8
at that time and within a very short period of time after I
9
10
had had my interview with Colonel Pash, I was transferred to the
Guatemala project, the overthrow of Guatemala.
11
WARD & PAUL
12
Mr. Baron. Is that the reason why you did not follow up
on the problem with this particular suspected double agent
after not receiving satisfaction from Colonel Pash?
13
Mr. Hunt. That certainly could have been one reason.
14
On the other hand, I was chief of, I can see I'm really going
15
16
to have to get into a lot more here. This is going to be.
dry and dull stuff for you.
17
The late King Zog was avelient of mine sin the sense that
18

in Egypt. I had made a trip at one time over to Egypt to
20
try to intercede indirectly with Colonel Nasser for King Zog
21
who was very upset about the disappearance and loss of all
22
of his partisans in the operations that the Agency was conducting.
23
24
And he was my concern much less the the counter-
intelligence or espionage aspect, which is not my function, but

I had a client-King to worry about. And also, we were trying
to bring Zog into this country. So I became interested as
3
4

5
a matter of King Zog's disaffection in what was happening tor
his rotainers Why were they being parachuted to their
deaths in Albania? And that was my introduction to the whole
6

8
scene in West Germany, where the balance of his retainers were
being held by the CIA. Well, not being held, but where they
were being housed and trained for Albanian operations.
Mr. Baron.
9
Can you explain the term "retainer"?
10
11
12
13
Mr. Hunt. Well, I understood that when he finally got
out of Albania, that he brought with him what I can best
describe as retainers. That is bodyguards, members of his
personal staff, probably some relatives. I think he had
four or five sisters with him. But the able-bodied portion
14
15
16
17
of those loyalists who came out with him we had largely taken
over thanks to Zog, who, in offect, ordered them to cooperate
with us. And then he never saw them again. He naturally
became apprehensive.
18
19
20
So that was my interest in what was happening to the
Albanians that we parachuted in through King Zog. I had no
functional counter-espionage interest in the affair. This

would have been handled and this was handled by the Chief
of Counter-espionage for the Division.
Mr. Baron. Who would that have been at the time?
Mr. Hunt. I can't remember at this point.

But that would be the person primarily
responsible for taking care of this double agent problem?
Mr. Hunt. That's correct.
Mr. Baron. Are you aware of what happened with that
suspected double agent?
5

10
Mr. Hunt. I have no idea because, as I may have indicated
previously off the record, it became apparent some years later
that the unfortunate fate of our Albanian agents was linked
far more closely to the revelations of Kim Philby, the
Soviet agent who was in direct liaison with us in Washington
11
12
and in Great Britain, rather than any penetration, although
the possibility of a penetration was of course always there.
But I don't think that anybody was ever focused.

Again, I left for Latin American affairs. I left the
Division about that time and I really never heard about it
again. Dong Blaufarb, the Albanian chief, departed for
Southeast Asia, and the whole sort of complex of knowledgeable
people was broken up through normal transfers and special
activities like the Guatemala project.
Mr. Baron. Was Doug Blaufarb, knowledeable about your
approach to Colonel Pash?
18

would have discussed anything with Colonel Pash about the

24
Mr. Baron. Who else would have known that you approached

Mr. Hunt. Very likely he was, yes. I don't think I

Colonel Pash with the idea in mind of seeing if an assassination
or a kidnapping couldn't be arranged?
Mr. Hunt. The then Chief of Foreign Intelligence and
Counter-Intelligence for the Division.
4
And I think now that that
5
6
was Charley English, Charles English. I think he wore both
hats. He had both foreign intelligence responsibility and
7
8
9
10
11
the counter-intelligence responsibility. And I might have told
the division chief about it, although it was not, it had not
achieved such stature at that point that I would have
necessarily talked to the Division Chief, who I believe at
that time was John Richardson of later Vietnam fame.
i
12
13
14
15
It's also possible that the Division Chief in that era
was John Baker, now deceased, who left that division to
become Chief of the PP staff, and that would have been a
normal follow through for me if I had discussed it with John
16
17
18
19
20
Baker, my direct Chief, and then to have discussed it with
him when he was my staff chief in the overall political and
psychological staff.
Mr. Baron. Anyone else who would have known about your
approach to Colonel Pash or about
21
Mr. Hunt. Or his function.
22
23
Mr. Baron. Yes, that Colonel Pash was considered to have
assassinations as one of his functions.
24
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
NW 50955 DocId: 32202418 Page 10
Mr. Hunt. We had a Colonel Buffington who at that time
25 was a member of the PP staff, the overall PP staff, and I think

that he would have been knowledgeable about it.

Mr. Baron. Was that Milton Buffington?

Tracy Barnes, Mr. John Baker, who I've already mentioned, and Mr
Lewis W. Thompson. These men were all at one time or another
chiefs of the Agency's PP staff.

Another man now living to the best of my knowledge who
might well have had knowledge of Pash's function was the
