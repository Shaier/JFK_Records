Ref: DIR 759487 |
1. S-1 was met on the evening of 28 October, at his Miami
apartment, to inform him of the following:

A. His old DGI chum, Ramon Cesar CUENCA Montoto,
appeared to be settling down for an extended stay
in Caracas.
B. Consequently, our people had decided to study him
in depth and decide at a later date what action, if
any, could or should be taken against him. i.e.
to pitch or not to pitch.
C. Our office had asked me to thank him for his offer
to assist in any operation and would keep him in
mind in any future plans. 5-1 was grateful to hear
these words and reiterated his willingness/availability
to help out in this or any other Operation.

2. I thought this to be the most diplomatic and effective way
to treat this issue. I wanted to give him an answer yet not
say we didn't think him the most likely candidate.
5-1 nus
always been PRESENT when we needed volunteers. He longs to
get back in the "business" and there is no doubt he can do
the job. They don't core any "gutsier." He never know when
we'll need him and its good to know he is there.

SUBJECT:	Contact Report on SLANK-1.(S-1)

16 October 1975

1. S-1 was visited on the evening of 15 October, at his new
address (5501 NW 7th St, apt 1065) same phone (443-5463)
to discuss recent HUS requirements.

2. S-1 was excited to learn his old boss: Ramon Cesar CUENCA
Montoto is in Caracas. "I just knew he had to be there because
the Cuban Ambassador (Norberto HERNANDEZ Curbelo) was my boss
in the DGI (c. 1963-64) and Cesar' was above us both."
(In other words, in c. 1963-64, CUENCA was superior in rank
to both S-1 and HERNANDEZ -the present Cuban Ambassador to
Venezuela.) (CUENCA was know as Cesar to his coworkers/friends)...

3. S-1 is serioulsly ready, willing and able to partake in any
Agency Operation against CUENCA and/or HERNANDEZ.
AMCIT and has a valid US passport. His only consideration is
obtaining the proper permission from his employers. This is
a matter which the Agency MUS solicit for him. As previously
reported, 5-1 workes for:
S-l is an
Metro Transit Authority
(bus driver)
3300 NW 32. Avenue, Miami.

4. The persons to be contacted at NTA, to grant S-1 the necessary
leave are:
Mr. FNU CROSS and
Mr. M. C. BUTLER

The ball is in our court. You cannot ask for a more dedicated/
motivated/educated (re the DSI) than S-1. S-l will be ready to
travel the minute Agency obtains necessary permission from MIA.

5. Re: "FERNANDEZ" -the Yemen based Cuban military instructor-"
S-1 reports NEGATIVE. (SLARSTICK-1 had previously reported NEGATIVE)

6. Whatever decision HQS takes, would appreciate being informed
so we can notify S-1. He is most dedicated/valuable assest
and we owe him this courtesy. In past, he has been alerted and
we have failed to notify him of abortions, and left him hanging
in midir.
