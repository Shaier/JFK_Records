MIKROFE
1. Project XDFACTOR was amended 10 December 1971 for
$4,260 for FY 1971 to cover the termination bonuses for
KDFACTOR-1 and KDFACTOR-7. The Project amendment also provides
funds of $19,000 for FY 1972 and $20,000 for FY 1973.
2. One of the provisos of the Froject amendment is that the
Station furnish Headquarters an updated security review of this
oporation with particular attention of the knowledgeability of
terminated agents and their families. The Station should also
address itself to the contingency that the present sites or
personnel will be blown and investigate alternate means of
continuing the KDFACTOR coverage. Please forward the security
review to arrive at Headquarters no later than 15 March 1972.

:. ΗΜΜΑ-39,679, 28 October 1970
1. Primary responsibility for the operational and
administrative handling of the LIEMPTY Project was transferred,
effective 1 December 1970, within the Station from the REDTOP..
to the Operational Support Section, This transfer was made
as part of our effort to consolidate basic support functions
in the Operational Support Section, and to relieve the REDTOP
Section of activities which do not contribute directly to the
pursuit of priority recruitment targets. However, the REDTOP
Section will continue to be the principal consumer of the
LIEMPTY product as received from the LILYRIC and LICALLA
photo surveillance points. It will also be the main provid-
er of guidance and requests for special LILYRIC/LICALLA
coverage.
2. The previous REDTOP Case Officer (Bruce H. FERNALD)
introduced the new Case Officer, Howard T. BAGAUS, to LIEMPTY-
9, -13, and -14 in early December. LIMOUSINE, owner of the
LILYRIC property, will continue to be handled by Timothy M.
ARCHBOLD of the REDTOP Section.

MICROFIL
1. Headquarters' confusion regarding the various LIEMPTY
properties is understandable, although each change in location
was duly reported as it occurred, and at various times project
renewal requests, progress reports, and other correspondence has
pinpointed the locations of the base houses involved. The con-
fusion undoubtedly stems from the unfortunate fact that LIMITED
and LILYRIC in effect exchanged approximate locations in 1966
without changing cryptonyms. Up to this point, LIMITED had been
in a building owned by WOFIRM (with LIMOUSINE fronting for WOFIRM).
LILYRIC had been renting an apartment in a building in which
WOFIRM had no financial interest. In 1965, however, LIMOUSINE
bought the property containing the building in which LIMITED had
been located, razed the building, and built a new building in
which an apartment was rented to the Station (the rent, however,
was to be returned to the Station for three years as partial
payment on the loan which the Station had given LIMOUSINE so that
he could buy the building) For various operational reasons it
was decided to put the LILYRIC personnel into the new building,
instead of the LIMITED crew, LIMITED was therefore moved into the
building which LILYRIC had occupied. At this point, of course,
new cryptonyms should probably have been assigned in order to
avoid the confusion which has evidently developed. (This was not,
however, simply a switch of personnel - each base house retained..
its organizational integrity, which is undoubtedly why crypts were
not changed). As far as LICALLA Is concerned, the confusion

probably stems from the fact that, while its location has not
changed, it is located within the LIMUST building, which is
owned by BOFIRM (with LIMOUSINE acting as "front") and which is
administered within the LIMESA project. As stated, however, all
of this has been carefully documented for Headquarters. The
LIMOUSINE purchase of the old LIMITED building generated consid-
erable correspondence (see particularly MEXI 2159 and DIR 77745
of January 1965). MMA-28322 and HMMA-30403 spelled out the
reasons for switching LILYRIC and LIMITED, and the completion
of the move was reported in HMMY-30687, Finally, sketches and
plans of the LILYRIC and LIMITED houses in their new locations
were forwarded with HMMA-31303, dated 7 February 1967. As far
as LICALLA is concerned, its location and status was never open
to question, and its location in the LIMEST complex is regularly
mentioned in LIMESA progress renewal requests. The Station under-
stands that a memo describing the locations of the various base
houses was attached to the most recent LDESA project: renewal
request when it was submitted to the staffs by WH/1.
2. Personnel within the base houses is also well-documented
(most of the LIEMPTY progress reports have identified each agent
in each house), and the personnel have never been switched from
house to house. Perhaps the best rundown of these personnel is
Raymond H. GERENDE's security review, forwarded with HMMA-31164,
24 January 1967.
3. Station Real Property reports are also, with one
exception (MEXI-41), up-to-date and they reflect current condi-
tions. MEXI-03 does, of course, include LICALLA. Nevertheless,
the Station asked for $1800 for rent and utilities for the
following reasons: first of all, utilities are an unrecoverable
expense no matter who owns the apartment. Secondly, the rent,
even though returned to the Station because WOFIRM owns the
building, must physically be paid by the occupant of LICALLA.
He, in turn, is reimbursed by the Station via GERENDE. LIMOUSINE
eventually returns the money, at which tize it is credited to
expense. This could, of course, be handled differently, but the
Station has always found it convenient to finance in this manner,
largely becausé finances with LIMOUSINE are handled on a semi-
annual basis. The reimbursement, therefore, often comes many
months after the payment.
4. The Station neglected to cancel MEXI-41, which should
be done as it refers to LILYRIC in its old location, before the
move in 1966. LILYRIC is now MEXI-132, and is in the building
owned by LIMOUSINE. Rent payments are, as originally intended,
being used to help liquidate LIMOUSINE's debt, and, as instructed
in HMMS-4814, 15 June 1966, the Station is crediting this money
to miscellaneous receipts. There can be, therefore, no question
of the need to include money for LILYRIC rent and utilities in
the LIEMPTY project. LILYRIC rent is, and has been since the
apartment was occupied in October 1966, 3,000 pesos per month,
which amounts to $2,880 per year ($3,200 has been requested in
order to include utilities). Headquarters is correct in stating
that the agreed-upon figure for the rent in this new building
was 2,300 pesos per month. Statior files indicate that the
reason for the increase (and this apparently was not reported
to Headquarters) was that the bank which holds the major part
of LIMOUSINE'S loan had determined that 3,000 pesos was a fair
price for the apartment. The Station had, of course, no choice
but to go along with this.
5. The Station has no record of MEXI-02, but it is likely
that this is the old LIMITED apartment, which was indeed
purchased by WOFIRM (via LIMOUSINE) in 1955. But since that
building was later purchased and razed by LIMOUSINE, the old
LIMITED apartment ceased to exist. The LIMITED base house was
subsequently transferred to the building which had previously
housed LILYRIC (but not to the same apartment), and LIMITED is

Thus
now carried, in its current location, as MEXI-113. As was the
case with old LILYRIC, the rent money is not returned to the
Station FOFIRM has no financial interest in the building.
it is evident that the LIEMPTY project renewal, which used to
say 'LIMITED and LICALLA rents are returned to Station by
LIMOUSINN and credited to Station miscellaneous receipts" should
now carry the footnote "LICALLArent is returned to the Station
and credited to expense; LILYRIC rent is, and will be through
September 1969, returned to the Station by LIMOUSINE and credited
to miscellaneous receipts as partial payment on Station loan to
LIMOUSINE."
6. Finally, the LIEMPTY darkroom is the room where the
films taken by LICALLA, LILYRIC, LIMITED, and LIENTRAP are
developed, printed, and (on request) enlarged by LIEMPTY-4.
This darkroom is located in GERENDE's apartment, and he is pald
1,000 pesos per month for maintenance of the darkroom in
recognition of the fact that one room in his living quarters
has been turned into a darkroom, and his electric and water
bills are substantially higher than they would normally be with-
out a darkroom on the premises. GERENDE is building a house
which he expects to occupy in February 1968. His plans for the
house specifically include a LIEMPTY darkroom, and he will continue
to be paid 1,000 pesos per month for this. To cover this payment
in the new house, MEXI-137 has been written and will be forwarded
to Headquarters shortly.

In answer to paragraph 5 of reference, it is hoped that
the following summary will end the confusion:

location since 1956, originally as a rented property.
September 1957 the building in which LICALLA is located
(which consists of four units, collectively known as
LIMUST) was purchased by the Station, with LIMOUSINE acting
as a front.
(4) Actual cost is nothing, since property is
owned by WOFIRM. The original purchase price for the
four units was $40,000.00 with an additional $20,000.00
spent on renovation. Rent is paid for cover purposes at
the annual rate of $1
