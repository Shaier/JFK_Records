pills?
TOP SECRET
43
Mr. O'Connell. The man that created them is Dr. Raymond
3
4
Trichler.
Mr. Schwarz. Did.he hand the pills to you?
5
Mr.
O'Connell. Yes.
6
Mr. Schwarz. Did he know what the pills were for?
7
Mr. O'Connell. I don't think so.
8
Mr. Schwarz. But he knew they were illegal?
9
Mr. O'Connell.
He knew they were illegal.
10
Mr. Schwarz.
And were the pills not tried out on some
11
experimental subjects in the U.S.?
12
Mr. O'Connell. Yes.
13
Mr. Schwarz. And proven to be lethal?
14
Mr. O'Connell. Well, to the extent
I will tell you
15
that, we used them on hamsters.
16
Mr. Schwarz. And also monkeys?
17
Mr. O'Connell. No, as far as I know, just the hamsters.
18
Mr. Schwarz. But anyway, you knew they were lethal.
Mr. O'Connell. Yes.
19
Mr. Schwarz. And you handed them over to Rosselli?
20
Mr. O'Connell. Yes.
21
Mr. Schwarz. And had the Technical Services made poison
22
pills before as far as you know?
23
Mr. O'Connell. As far as I know. I have no idea.
24
This was my first experience with that sort of thing.

2
I am giving to you now.
3
Mr. Madigan.
We don't have it presently.
4
5
Mr. O'Connell. I am sure it is over there.
ة
Mr. Wides. With regard to the discussion of authorization,
6
7
8
and that you would have asked, is this authorized?
would it have been following on Mr. Madigan's point, that this
was a fairly serious and unusual operation that you were given,
Or how did
9
the question of Mr. Dulles authorizing it come up, as best you
10
recall?
11
12
WARD & PAUL
13
14
Mr. O'Connell. I told you, I knew that Mr. Dulles I was
told that Mr. Dulles had authorized it, I can't say quite when
it happened, but I know I was told.
Mr. Wides. You testified this morning I don't want
15
to put words in your mouth I thought you testified that you
16
were sure that Mr. Edwards told you at this meeting when he first
17
gave you the assignment that you were not sure that Mr. Bissell's
18
also mentioned that when you later met in your office.
19
Mr. O'Connell.
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
I would stick with that, yes. I think it
20
probably was when I
when Colonel Edwards called me he
21
said, this probably has the blessing of the DCI.
22
Mr. Wides. Do you know if Dr. V. S. Roosevelt, who
23
was head of the Technical Services Division at the time, was
1
24
witnessing about this?
25
Mr. O'Connell. I wouldn't want to bet my life that he

wasn't. But he was at a meeting when the bills were delivered,
and Dro Treichler came over to Colonel Edwards'office.

5
Mr. Wides. But you don't recall whether you ever knew
that Koosevelt knew what it was in connection with as distinct
from merely knowing it was a lethal pill, is that right?

Mr. O'Connell. I can't say to my personal knowledge,
the discussion never came up when I was there. I don't think
he is a dummy, and I don't think Treichlen is any dummy, and
I think they had a general idea.
10
11
But as far as I know they were never officially told.
Mr. Wides. To your knowledge, before you went overseas
12
WARD & PAUL
13
14
no one else in the office of Security, Mr. Bannerman, Mr.
White or Mr. Hall, none of those men or anyone else knew about
the project, only yourself and Mr. Edwards?
15
16
17
18
Mr. O'Connell. Well, I would say this, to my knowledge
they were never briefed. However, I think I brought up an
incident this morning where Colonel Edwards was on leave and
Colonel King called Mr. Bannerman, who was his
19
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
20
deputy, and assumed that Bannerman knew all about it and started
talking about it, what are we going to do about
21
22
this I don't know what the conversation was about.
Bannerman called in and said, what was this all about?
And
23
Mr. Wides.
This was in 1962 before you left?
24
Mr. O'Connell. Yes. It was while I was up in the office.
25
And I said, I don't have the authority to brief you on it.

Were you ever aware, whether you were formally
notified or just got a rumble or heard through the grapevine,
that the CIA was getting some information about these threats,
or some information about groups who might pose a threat in the
Washington area, not from Bureau sources or military sources,
but from CIA sources, did you ever hear any rumble of that kind?
Mr. O'Connell. Yes.
7
8
Mr. Wides. What did you hear?
9
Mr. O'Connell. The only way I got involved in it was that
10
11
Howard Osborn would have a nine o'clock meeting every
morning with his deputies.
12
WARD & PAUL
13
And they had a proprietary organization in the Office of
Security which I think had informants.
14
Now, I don't know their identities, but it would come out
15
16
in the meeting, and they would have some names for them.
couldn't tell you what they were.
I
17
Mr. Madigan. What was the proprietary called?
18
Mr. O'Connell. The name that strikes me
and I
19

20
know part of it, but I couldn't tell you exactly I think it
was Anderson

Mr. Madigan. Anderson Stuart?
22.
Mr. O'Connell. Anderson Stuart, something like that.
23
Mr. Wides. You say you think they had informants?
24
Mr. O'Connell. They obviously did, I guess, because the

way this would come out, so-and-so advised at a meeting last

Mr. Wides.
If you associate that with Andersont
you must have been told more than just, we have an informant.
How would it be discussed at the meeting, through this
proprietary we have access to information?
Mr. O'Connell. No, it usually would be the Deputy
Director that that was under. And that was under OIS.
10
Victor White.
Mr. Wides. And what would he say about how Anderson
w.
11
fitted into the picture?
12
Mr. O'Connell. That never came up.
I
WARD & PAUL
just drew that
13
14
conclusion, that they had potential.
Mr. Wides. Why would you assume that they used a proprie-
15
16
tary as opposed to just having some agents penetrate a group?
Why would you think in terms of their using the Anderson
17
Mr. O'Connell. I can tell you what I think.
18
19
First of all, I wouldn't want to use government employees.
Mr. Wides.
Why couldn't the CIA personnel just run

agents who would be

Mr. O'Connell.
That is in fact what they were doing.

These people that were proprietary were not CIA employees. They
were pontract teams.
24
Mr. Wides. Why would you have thought that they would have
25
gone the route of using the proprietary people as opposed to

Did you have any knowledge during the 1970-1971 time frame

of any effort outside of Florida with regard to Cubans to fire
on the Keys or on the Florida area there with a boat that
4

would be disguised as a Russian boat, which was really a
group of people, some of whom were assets of the Agency?
Mr. O'Connell. No.
7
Mr. Madigan. You never heard of anything like that?
8
Mr. O'Connell. Nothing of that, no.
9
Mr. Madigan. Did you ever run across a fellow by
10
11
the name of Jerry Henning in your dealing with Roselli
and Maheu?
12
Mr.O'Connell. No.
WARD & PAUL
13
14
Mr. Madigan. You never heard of the name?
Mr. O'Connell. I never heard of the name.
15
Mr. Madigan. Did you handle the Agency contact with Mr.
16
Maheu about having him coordinate or set up or be involved
17
18
in the supplying of a female to this foreign leader back in 19592
Mr. O'Connelll. A couple of them, as a matter of fact.
19
Mr. Madigan.
A couple of foreign leaders?
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Mr. O'Connell.
Yes.
20
21
Mr. Madigan. What was your involvement in that?
Am I
22
right about 1959?
Mr. O'Connell.
23
It could be. There were two different
occasions.

Mr. Madigan. What is your recollection as to the dates?

Well, the first one was

3
Mr. Madigan. And how did that come about? Why did it go to
4
you in the Office of Security as opposed to
5
Mr. O'Connell.
Just like this other one came down from the

DDP, it came from the
Division, as
7
I recall it. And
was coming into the

(Discussion off the record.)
Mr. Madigan. What did your first contact with Maheu
with regard to this project involve?
12
Mr. O'Connell. Well, the request came to the Security.
WARD & PAUL
13
Mr. Madigan. It came down to you?
14
Mr. O'Connell. It came through Colonel Edwards.
15
Mr. Madigan. To you?
Mr. O'Connell. Yes. And the requirement was a certain type
16
17
female who would attract this foreign leader. He wanted female
companionship
18
Mr. Madigan. The leader?
19
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
Mr. O'Connell. The leader did.
20
21
Mr. Madigan. So did you contact Maheu directly?
Mr. O'Connell. Yes.
22
23
Mr. Wides. In this instance you were talking about
24
a leader sho would be in America, or to supply companionship
Wherever the leader was abroad?

wanted some female companionship. And his case officer, the
Agency's case officer that was handling the leader, said,
let's stick to business while you are in New York. And we will
take you out to the West Coast and that is going to be a
pleasure trip, and we will see that you meet the right people.

So Maheu lined up this young lady who was a starlet, a
little cutie, and they knew the type he liked size and
everything
So they threw a cocktailparty for him very informal
Cocktail party --
Mr. Madigan. Mahen did?
Mr. O'Connell. It was a fellow named Gregg Bautzer. He
14
15
16
17
used to be married to some very famous actress, and he knows
just about anything and everything that walks in skirts in L.A.
and Hollywood
So Maheu called Gregg and asked him if he could come up
18
19
with something according to certain specs. And he did. And she
was placed in the right atmosphere, at the right time and the
20
leader went head over heels in love with her, to
the extent
21
that it was. beyond what we planned He really fell in love wit
22
her
23
Mr. Madigan. Was a fellow named Norman Paul involved
24
in this?

Mr. O'Connell. No. Normal Paul at one time was the
head of the Division that I mentioned a little while ago, But
he wasn't involved in it
So what we thought was going to be a passing fancy, he
decided he had to go back to New York, and he insisted that she
go back with him.
Well, this was getting a little embarrassing, because here
he is the head of his country, and he has got this gal on the
strings.
So, we agreed to it and she agreed to it, but we had to keep
her in one hotel
she was staying at the Waldorf-
12
WARD & PAUL
13
Astoria and he was staying in another place. And we go
house out in Long Island so they could have their rendevouz,
got a

individual who was a friend of somebody who was with the
Agency
Mr. Madigan. - Did you handle that?
Mr. O'Connell. The field office handled that, the
New York field office.
Mr. Madigan. Of the Office of Security?
Mr. O'Connell. They handled procuring the house out in

Long Island. And then they also supplied people to stay with
the young lady whie she was in New York, because they didn't

Kagainst her will, it was just to give her somebody that could

the leader.

Mr. Madigan.
And was that the end of that particular
6
project that you recall?
7

9
10
11
Mr. O'Connell. That was the end of it, except that we had
Some repercussions, where he went back to his country
and was lovesick, and he was going to give up the throne,
which would have caused all sorts of consternation in the Agency,
because that was the last guy that the Agency wanted to leave.

But he was communicating with her for a while, and then
eventually we got her a job in a local musical -- that is
really all that she was interested in, trying to make it in the
theater. And they drifted off, and she subsequently married.
Mr. Wides. Did the Agency monitor the mail between him
and the lady, either before she got it or after she got it?
Mr. O'Connell. Yes.
Mr. Wides. Before? Did they intercept the mail, or how was
the mail handled, through special channels?
Mr.O'Connell. We set up a post office box at his request,
and we serviced the box
Mr. Wides. And would you look at the mail before it was
passed on?,

to the Division.
Mr. Wides. Did she understand that the Agency was some
how involved in the passage of return mail from the lady
to the world leader, that she just didn't drop it on the
mailbox on the corner?
12
13
Mr. O'Connell. She delivered it to somebody up in the fiell
office, as I recall → don't hold me to that, but I think that
14 was it and then it was sent down to headquarters.
15
Mr. Wides. Was it your impression that the Agency read
16 that wall, too, on its way back?
17
18

Mr. O'Connell. I would imagine so, because it got out of
our control.
Mr. Wides. Let me go back.
With regard to the mail coming in, is it your imagination,

Mr. Madigan. Yousaid there was a second instance.

Was there a second instance which involved a female

earlier off the record?

Mr. Madigan. And was that entire situation handled overseas
when you once got over there?
Mr. O'Connell Yes.r
Mr. Madigan. Was there any business of the leader
coming back here with her?
Mr. O'Connell. Not with her. He came back sometime, maybe
a year later, and wanted to know whether he could see her
23
24
again. And we made arrangements for her to attend the party
that was given by Kay Star, the singer. And they threw a
25

3
And we had that gal, we got in touch with her again, and she did
attend the party. But it was a social affair, and there was
4
no operation involved in it.
5
Mr. Madigan. Did Maheu set that up?
6
Mr. O'Connelll.
Yes.
7
Mr. Mdigan. Both the original contact and the later party
8
in San Francisco?
9
Mr. O'Connell. Yes.
10
Mr. Madigan. And were those the only two times now that
11
he was involved in the operations field?
12
Mr. O'Connelll. Oh, no. He did a lot of other things.
WARD & PAUL
13
Mr. Madigan. Let me ask you this question.
14
When Maheu was having his problems with the authorities,
15
16
was there any reference back to his involvement in those kind of
activities, or was the only discussion about his role in
the so-called assassination plot?
17
Mr. O'Connell. Well, I am not
18
even so sure that they got
into that aspect of it. It was just that he was involved
19
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
20
21
22
to the extent that he had set up the operation against Rowan,
or he was the one that got in touch with DuBois to do it.
Mr. Wides. When did you come back from overseas?
Mr. O'Connell. July of 1965.
23
Mr. Wides. After you came back did you learn of a time,
24
either after you came back or very shortly before you came

Mr. O'Connell.
Never, to my knowledge he never got

involved in that, officially or otherwise.
4
Mr. Wides. Or surreptitious entry?
5
6
Mr. O'Connell. He did one surreptitious entry for us once
Mr. Wides. What were the specifics of that?
7
8
9
10
11
Mr. O'Connell. There were a group of Iranian students.
The Agency was sponsoring them, and they were going to the
Georgetown School of Linguistics. And they were staying
in a rooming house up there right outside of Georgetown some-
here. And one of the students came to the case officer
12
WARD & PAUL
13
14
15
16
and said that one of the group was acting very suspiciously,
taking a lot of notes where they were not supposed to be taking
notes, or certainly after operational briefings, and he would go
back to his room and he would write voluminous notes. And
he thought that was very strange that this guy was not acting
as he should.
17
18
19
410 First Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20003
20
21
And that aroused the suspicion ofthe case officer.
And they wanted to know whether we would get in and photo-
graph what he was writing to see whether he was really
violating his agreement.
So I called Maheu and he went up to the rooming house, and
22
23
he went to the people who owned the house and asked if they
had a room to rent and she had one. And he did know where the
24
students
were staying. And she showed him one room. And
