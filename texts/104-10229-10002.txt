MOLINA HAD DIED 25 FEBRUARY 1962.
2. AMI IKI-1 ON 23 JULY 1968 COMPLETED A BREAKDOWN OF
THE ACCOUNT SHOWING THE AMOUNT IN THE BANK WHICH IS SHOUN
IN PARAGRAPH I BABOVE, THE AMOUNT PAID TO THE ORIGINAL TRUSTEE
WHICH IS $2,925.00 AND THE AMOUNT DUE MRS. CLARA MOLINA.
SINCE MRS. MOLINA'S HUSBAND DIED PRIOR TO AMT IKI-1 TAKING
OVER AS TRUSTEE, THE PAYMENTS DURING AMT IKI-I'S TRUSTEESHIP
SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE RATE OF $175.00 PER MONTH INSTEAD OF
THE $225.08. MAY 1962 THROUGH JULY 1968 (75 MONTHS) AT
$175.00 PER MONTH AMOUNTS TO $ 13,125.00 AND AS NOTED IN
PARAGRAPH I B ABOVE THE ACCOUNT CONTAINS $13,985.57.

AND PURCHASE A CASHIER'S CHECK FOR MRS. MOLINA FOR THE TOTAL
AMOUNT DUE ($13,125.00) AND PASS THE BALANCE OF $780.57.TO
THE JMWAVE FINANCE OFFICER. FOLLOWING THIS AND BEGINNING
WITH THE AUGUST 1968 PAYMENT AMIKI-I WILL FORWARD A CHECK
FOR $175.00 EACH MONTH TO MRS. CLARA MOLINA IN THE SAME
MANNER AS OTHER BRIGADE DEPENDENTS. JMWAVE PLANS TO HAVE
ANT IK 1-1 PROVIDE MRS. MOLINA WITH THE NAME OF THE OR IG INAL
TRUSTEE AND THE AMOUNT PAID TO HIM WITH REGRETS THAT HE CANNOT
ASSIST HER IN THIS MATTER. WE ALSO PALN TO HAVE ANT IX-1
EXPLAIN THE METHOD OF COMPUTING THE $13,125.00 TOTAL ($175.00
PER MONTH FOR 75 MONTHS). WE DO NOT PLAN TO RAISE THE PO INT
OF EARNED INTEREST. WE BELIEVE THAT WOFIRM WOULD HAVE
COMPLETELY FULFILLED ITS OBLIGATION TO MRS. MOLINA BY THE
ABOVE PAYMENT PLUS HER MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO FOLLOW. PLEASE
CONCUR IN THIS PARAGRAPH BY CABLE.

Request for Additional Information on The ANBUD Dependency Cases
ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
Action Required: See Paragraph 1
1
1. It is requested that Raymond K. PANUSES rocheck the file
of Miguel Los Santos DELGADO Martinez (Case No. 97) in an effort
to determine the cause and actual date of his death. Headquarters
file does not reflect this information nor the reason why his
dependents are paid under the AMBUD program. In thoso few coses
of former active assets whose dependents are paid by AMTIKI, the
exact date and circumstance of death is necessary for documentation.
2. It is also requested that ANTIKI be queried regarding
certain vital documents which should be in the file of Benito
BLANCO Cruz (Case No. 3). A copy of a letter from the widow,
dated 11 January 1962, indicated that her marriage certificate
and the birth certificates of her children were enclosed with the
letter. It is possible, but unlikely, these documents were over-
looked when the file was recently reviewed. In any event, the
work check sheet used by the documentation team indicates these
documents were missing from the file.
