Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Tovar, my name is Michael Goldsmith,

I have been designated by the Committee to take your deposition

script of a deposition to be made available to a witness and
actually be delivered for Detention by any witness that gives
the Committee a statement. However, by virtue of the arrange-
ment that the Committee has worked out with the CIA, the Agency
has asked us to request Agency employees testifying before us
to waive the right actually to receive a copy of the transcript.
NW 48331 DocId: 32277210 Page 4

The reason for that is because the transcript frequently

will contain classified information and the Agency prefers for
that information to be kept in our secure area here. So I

would like to ask you to waive your right to receive a copy of

Mr. Tovar. I agree.
Mr. Goldsmith. I would like to inform you that the court
reporter will provide you with a transcript and the transcript
will be certified by the reporter as a complete, accurate and
true record of all the testimony that you give here today.
Now, you are employed by the CIA, is that correct?
Mr. Tovar. Yes.
Mr. Goldsmith. I had given you earlier a copy of a letter
dated 23 March 1978 from Mr. Carlucci to the Chairman of this
Have you had a chance to read that letter?

Mr. Goldsmith. Have you had a chance to review CIA
document number 1817 and the pages that follow it?
Mr. Tovar. Yes, I have read these. I had not read these.
They were released by one of my subordinates, Mr. Friedlander.
\
Mr. Goldsmith. Are you telling us that today is the first
chance you had to read them?
:
Mr. Tovar. I did not read them this time. They went to
you, to the Committee but I have since read them.
Mr. Goldsmith. They were prepared by whom?
Mr. Tovar. Jack Friedlander, Chief of Operations.
7
They
were signed by him, not prepared by him. They would have been
originated probably by Mr. Kowalski or Mr. Bradley, I am not
sure which. I think Kowalski almost certainly.
Mr. Goldsmith. The memorandum which is labeled CIA No.
1817 was a response by the Agency to an inquiry by the
Committee as to whether it was standard operating procedure for
the Agency to debrief what in effect were repatriated defectors.
I believe it is fair to say by way of summary that the memo
says that it was not in fact standard operating procedure
during the years 1959 to '63 to debrief such individuals. Is
that correct?

the current policy was then.
What I have been told since by those who should know is
that there was no policy as set forth here.

5
Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know what the criteria were for
selecting the 117 individuals whose files were reviewed?
6

Mr. Tovar. No. I think someone mentioned the other day
that the names were incorporated in a memorandum I think ori-
ginionally by the FBI but would not certify to that.

Mr. Tovar, since you have no direct
knowledge as to the manner in which this memo was prepared and,
for example, you don't know the criteria that was used for
choosing these 117 people, I am not going to ask you questions
pertaining to that document. I would like to request that you
communicate with the Office of Legislative Counsel at the
Agency and tell them the individual who was involved in the
actual direct preparation of the document so that I could spend
some time with him.
Mr. Tovar. The document, of course, is over my signature,
so I stand behind the document. I am responsible for what
was said there. If it is_ncorrect then I am incorrect in
leeting that document out. I have no personal first hand know-
ledge of the research he did to arrive at the conclusion here

CIA no. 1818 indicates that CI Staff has completed a
review of the files of 117 US persons who had "defected" to
the USSR between 1959 and 63 and since returned to the United
States. Is that correct? '58 to '63?
Mr. Tovar. Yes.
Mr. Goldsmith. I would like you to review the statement
under the name Thomas Morrdian. M-O-R-R-I-D-I-A-N. While you
read that paragraph, I wil.. state for the record thst the way
the memo is set forth it indicates that it was not standard
operating procedure to debrief such individuals, that of 117
people whose files were reviewed only ten were debriefed.
12 Then it proceeds to list the ten individuals who in fact were
debriefed.
13
14
I have now requested lir. Tovar to read the first summary
which is right next to the name of the first person who was
debriefed.
15
16
17
Mr. Tovar. Yes sir.

Mr.
Goldsmith. When did that individual defect?

I
21
Mr. Goldsmith. So that in fact that individual was not
22
someone who defected between 1958 and 1963?
23
Mr. Tovar. That is correct.
24
Mr. Goldsmith.
Let us look at the next individual under

Mr. Tovar. Yes sir.
Mr. Goldsmith. When did Mr. Marshall defect?
Mr. Tovar. It is not clear. He was born in the US in
1897. He said he was employed in Hawaii in 1921. There is no
indication whence he went 1:0 the USSR.
Mr. Goldsmith. Theres no indication he defected between
'58 and '63?
Mr. Tovar. No. He was arrested by the Soviets in 1945.
Conceivably he might have defected after that.
Mr. Goldsmith. The letter "C", Tommaro S-G-O-V-I-O.
Would you please read that section and tell us when this indi-
vidual defected?
13
Mr. Tovar.
Again, he went to the USSR with his parents
14
15
in the 1930s. No indication when he defected. He left the
USSR in 1960. No way of telling.
16
17
Mr. Goldsmith. This individual did not defect between
58 and '63?
13
Mr. Tovar. At last we have no indication he did. One
19
would assume to the contrary.
Mr. Goldsmith.
20
Letter "D", Mary Mackler, will you please
21
read the first summary and tell us when she defected?
22
23
24
25
Mr. Tovar. There is ro indication when she defected.
She went to the USSR with her parents in 1931. Sometime after,
married a Soviet.
Mr. Goldsmith. Again, no indication she defected between

'58 and '63?

Mr. Tovar. No.
Mr. Goldsmith. Would you look at letter "E". Sonia and
Fred A-S-I-N-I-A-N. When did they defect?
Mr. Tovar. They renounced their US citizenship in 1948.

So I assume that is the operative year.

Mr. Goldsmith. Will you look at the letter "F" now?
Mr. Tovar. Jack Kuralski.
Mr. Goldsmith. When did he defect?
Mr. Tovar. He recounced his US citizenship in 34 and
departed USSR I assume in 1934.
Mr. Goldsmith. The point I am trying to make is that the
memo responding to the Committee's inquiry makes reference to
ten individuals who defected between the years '58 and '63.
Itothen proceed to provide us with ten names. But in fact,
15
15
if we continue to look through the list we will see that seven
17
of the ten individuals did not defect during that time period.
la
Some of them did return ducing that time period.
19
Mr. Tovar. And were debriefed.
20
Mr. Goldsmith. And were debriefed.
21
Mr. Tovar. Contacted.
22
Mr. Goldsmith. Of the ten, perhaps three or four returned
23
during the relevant time period. I asked those questions
24
25
mainly to draw your attention to the fact that the response
given was not really
NW 48331 DocId: 32277210 Page 11
TOP SECRET

Mr. Tovar. -- precisely what you wanted?
2
Mr. Goldsmith.
3
Yes.
Mr. Tovar. I don't know the answer to that. I would
:
4
5
assume that the criteria they applied here as best they could
was when did he defect, when did he return, was he debriefed
6
7
8
or contacted? In some cases they hit one out of three, in
other cases two out of three. I think they were giving the
best correlation with your criteria that they could.
9
Mr. Goldsmith. I understand that. My point might be then
10
11
that the introductory section should not have stated that these
were people in 1958 and '63 when in fact they were not.
12
Mr. Tovar. You are right. That is an incorrect statement
13
Is your requesting memo here? That is not a very good state-
14
ment.
IS
Mr. Goldsmith.
Here is the letter dated April 6, 1978
16
17

which I show you just for your information to show you what the
Committee was requesting from the Agency. If you will look
under number two.
19
20
21
22

25
Mr. Tovar. Then this would appear to correlate with that.
You asked to indicate whether the AGency from '58 to '63

time they defected is not the operative consideration.
Mr. Goldsmith. No, it was not.
Mr. Tovar. The time of the debriefing --
Mr. Goldsmith. Yes, that would be the focus.
So, the
NW 48331 DocId: 32277210 Page 12
TOP SECRET

11
Mr. Tovar. So these would be at least consistent with that.
Mr. Goldsmith. Yes, that is true. I would like also for
3

purposes of further clarifcation, to have you read the letter
dated May 12, 1978 starting with the second full paragraph.
It is not `numbered.

Mr. Tovar. Yes.
Mr. Goldsmith. I show you that only for your background
purposes, not to ask you any questions about it. In any event,
I would appreciate having the name of the individual who
prepared the memo passed along to the Office of the Legislative
Counsel.
Mr. Tovar. Yes sir.
12
13
Mr. Goldsmith. The response that was provided to the
14
Committee indicates that the CIA had no standard precedure for
15 debriefing returning US delectors. What was the basis for that
16
policy or actually for the absence of the policy?
17
13
19
Mr. Tovar. I don't know. I can speculate only
having been there and not having any involvement
know what mentality of those in charge was at that time.

I don't
20
21
Mr. Goldsmith. What would your specilation be?
Mr. Tovar. I would speculate that the contact with and

debriefing, in effect the supervision of Americans in that
category would be FBI's prerogative and the Agency as a rule
would not have had any basc interest or reason to be involvedaj
unless there were a specific counterintelligence concern.

Mr. Goldsmith. Again would you say you relied on the
FBI to conduct those interviews?
Mr. Tovar. Yes.
Mr. Goldsmith. Is there any coordination between the
Agency and the FBI so that the Bureau is informed when someone
in fact is returning?
Mr. Tovar. On American defectors, the type you are speak-
ing of here?
Mr. Goldsmith.
An American defector who is repatriated.
Mr. Tovar. I know of no case where they would be
interested in the subject. I can't say there is a procedure
in being. Knowing the way we relate to the FBI, if we knew of
a case of returning Americans, Say we learned it from an
overseas station and it seemed of interest, we would probably
refer it directly to the FBI by letter.
21
I am speculating here because I know of no case in point.
Mr. Goldsmith. There is no standard procedure for contact
22
23
ingthe Bureau and informing them of a returning defector?
Mr. Tovar. Not that :: am aware of.
24
Mr. Goldsmith.
You would be the person who would be aware
25
of such a procedure?

Mr. Tovar.
Berween the Soviet-East European Division and
CI Staff we should be aware of it. The two were most primarily
concerned with the USSR. I think one or the other of us would
inform the Bureau. This is not our primary concern: The
Americans, even when they have been naughty boys, having gone
to USSR and decided to return, we still don't have necessarily
a professional interest in that type of person.
Mr. Goldsmith. What is the responsibility of the CI Staff
within the CIA?
Mr. Tovar. In a couple of sentences it is a little
9
10
11
12
difficult. I will tell you what we do. The CI Staff has two
principal areas of activity. We are first of all a staff.
1
13
Are you familiar with the staff as opposed to the division?.
Mr. Goldsmith. No, I am not.
15
Mr. Tovar.
You have seen the table of organization of
15
DDO?
17
Mr. Goldsmith. Yes.
18
19
Mr. Tovar. You know generally how we are organized?
Mr. Goldsmith. Yes.
20
21
Mr. Tovar. The main set of components of the Directorate
is divisions and staffs.
The divisions operate a function overt
1
1
seas.
22
We are staff and that is in the military sense we support
23
the Directorat and we support the Director, we suppor one
24
another in an advisory capacity and in various ways. So, we
}
25
are not an operating component. We don't run spies. We have
NW 48331 DocId: 32277210 Page 15
TOP SECRET
14
1
a lot of activities which impact on operations but we are not in
2
the true sense of the term an operating element.
3
So, having said that, the primary field of activity for
4
the CI Staff is research and analysis, and then the other,
5
what we refer to as operations coordination. Now, that is sort

of the term which does not -- research and analysis is clear.
We examine and analyze cases, essentially cases. We are not
scrutinizing people. We are looking at intelligence operations
old and current, primarily things that are not terribly
current. We don't tend to follow current operations in the
analytic sense. We take od cases and look them over to see
if mistakes were made, to see if we can derive lesssons from
mistakes made in the past. We publish papers for the Agency's
community at large, all in the R&A field.
On the other side we function in the sense of a true staff.
We keep our fingers on the activity of the Directorate overseas.
We monitor what they are doing, not in the sense of being

normal distribution of most: correspondence coming back from
overseas. We keep a hand on the pulse of counterintelligence
activities abroad.
:
To do this, we obviously have to have reasonable currency
on operational activity across the board. So, we are generally
aware of the operational patterns of activity that prevail in
various overseas stations. On that basis we are in a position
NW 48331 DocId: 32277210 Page 16 TOP SECRET
15
1
2
3
4
to advise the DDO or Directorate as to the level of performance,
the kind of activity conducted, the quality, the proper or
improper degree of emphasis. We maintain an overview on behalf
of DDO.
5
6
Mr. Goldsmith. Is your concentration oriented towards
counterintelligence threats of a foreign nature?
7
Mr. Tovar. Yes, totally.
a
Mr. Goldsmith. You would not be concerned at all with
counterintelligence threats domestically?
10
Mr. Tovar. None whatsoever.
11
Mr. Goldsmith. Is it correct to say that would be the
12 responsibility of the Bureau?
13
Mr. Tovar. Absolutely.
14
15
16
:17
Mr. Goldsmith. Now, Lee Harvey Oswald returned from the
Soviet Union in 1962. While in the Sovietion Union he worked
as a worker in a radio factory. Upon his return I imagine there
was someone concerned about his being a counterintelligence
13
19

21
22
threat. Is it fair to say, and I do not want to ask you leading
questions but would it be fair to say that would be more
the responsibility of the Bureau rather than the Agency upon
his actual return?
Mr. Tovar. Yes, the question whether or not he was, let
23
us say, a counterintelligence threat.

24
Mr. Goldsmith.
KGB agent?
25
Mr. Tovar.
That would be a Bureau concern, no question

about that.
Mr. Goldsmith. However, would the Agency make any effort
to interview Osald while 0:3wald was entroute from the Soviet
Union to the United States?
Mr. Tovar. You are speaking of what the Agency might have
done in '63 or '62?
Mr. Goldsmith. '62.

It was not their primary precise prerogative.

21
22
Mr. Tovar. Again, we are speculating concerning the
intelligence of the men who were in charge then. Today I
would like to think we would be interested in what he is doing.
At the time I don't know. I would think, why not. On the
other hand, I couldn't say they would or should be interested.
I think if they
could, as I assume they did, the Bureau would discharge its
responsibilities vis-a-vis any American of questionable
propensity, I should think they would be deferring to the
Bureau.
Mr. Goldsmith. That would be the aspect of Oswald where
there was a concern taht he posed a counterintelligence threat.
What about the fact that Oswald may have had positive intelli-
gence information that would have been helpful to the Agency?
That would not be within the jurisdiction of the Bureau?
Mr. Tovar. I think in that context it might have been
appropriate for the Agency, if the assumed the point you made,

which I think handled most of the contacts referred to in this
memorandum.
Mr. Goldsmith. What is the function of the Domestic
Contact Division?
Mr. Tovar. They are responsible for intelligence that
can be checked properly and legally in the United States
normally through American businessmen or American persons and
nonofficials who travel abroad and acquire intelligence of
interest. This is not jus: USSR. It could be any other
country. Their primary field of activity is to contact and
debrief on a vluntary basis, if they so choose to respond,
Americans who return from overseas.
Mr. Goldsmith. I notice that the Committee's inquiry
IS concerning the CI's policy as to returning American defectors

was routed to your staff, CI Staff. When the memo was prepared
by the CI Staff for the Committee, was it done with the thought
of representing the entire agency or just the CI Staff?

Mr. Tovar. It is difficult for us to presume to speak for
the entire Agency. I think on this matter we are speaking for
the Directorate of Operations, not for the entire Agency.
22

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine. That is really the area with which
I was concerned anyway, Directorate of Operations.

Mr. Tovar. The only other element of the Directorate of
Operations that would be of an interest in this type of thing,
which might be construed as having an interest in this type

Mr. Goldsmith. Is the Domestic Contact Division part of
the CI Staff?
Mr. Tovar. No, part of the Directorate of Operations.
Mr. Goldsmith. The response of the Agency dated April
20, 1978, which appears in CIA Number 1818, indicates that
contact seems to be based on opportunity and circumstance.
Then it goes on to say only ten of the 117 persons have had
any contact with CIA. Would it be possible for you to go into
more dtail on what is meant by opportunity and circumstance?
Mr. Tovar. In the asecne of a policy, of a guideline, a
procedure, internal instruction which says you will debrief
Americans who return from having resided in the USSR, in the
#absence of that, this thing is left to chance obviously.

of whoever was in charge at the time, but assuming they did,
my guess, and it is really only a guess, would be that the
person who read that, whatever document it was, would say,
"Hmmph! He looks like he might be interesting", and perhaps
would then get in contact with CCD and suggest if they get in
contact with a person, let us say he is known to be living in

New York, suggest that they might want to seek out his location
and if possible interview him.

I think it would be a matter of chance in the sense that
the analyst or whoever it was who reviewed that document, might
react, and yet he or she might not, too, depending on how they
woke up that morning.
Its sheer whimsy.
Mr. Goldsmith. Let me explain to you why the question
whether or not it was standard operating procedure to debrief
returning defectors is important to the Committee. Since
the assassination of the President, there has arisen a group of
researchers who have reviewed the Warren Commission Report and
have reviewed releases made under the Freedom of Information
Act by the CIA and the FBI.

Having reviewed these materials the argument has been made
that Oswald received unusual treatment at the hands of the CIA.
One example of this unusual treatment is that there is no
record of Oswald having been debriefed by the CIA upon his
return. For that reason, we are focusing on this issue. Is
there any way you can give us guidance on how to respond to
that question?

Mr. Tovar. I can't becuase I am sphculating every step
along the way. I would hesitate to say more than Oswald
simply didn't connect with whoever happened to be looking
let us assume his name appeared. Was his namde in the list?
Mr. Goldsmith. No. That is the list of people who were
debriefed.
25
Mr. Tovar. One hundred seventeen?
