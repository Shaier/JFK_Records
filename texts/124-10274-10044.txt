On September 25, 1959, Jaffe, who is a good friend of the
Bureau and who did two radio shows on the New York Office, came by and talked
with Kemper.
Jaffe has been on the Khrushchev trip, and he said it was the most
hectic thing he has ever had to do in his life. He said there was no question about
Khrushchev's anger in Los Angeles and that one of the aides told him, "Don't be
surprised if the old man doesn't suddenly get up and go home." He said the
security of Khrushchev was badly handled and that Roswell Garst, Coon Rapids,
Iowa, the millionaire farmer, is no more than a publicity seeker and is a real
"corn ball."
He said one amusing thing happened in San Francisco. At about
7:15 in the morning Khrushchev decided to take a walk and, apparently, caught his/
bodyguards flatfooted. He headed down the street with the guards streaming out
the doors behind him, some of them buttoning their clothes as they ran.
Jaffe is trying to get back to Russia (CBS lost their correspondents
| after the television show that was critical of Stalin, et al.) and he has been working
with people at the embassy to try and get back. He said that he wanted to go back
and have a television interview with Khrushchev on his reaction to his trip and that
he had been in touch with Viktor Osipov, who is a second secretary in the embassy
and attached to the Cultural Section. He said that at the reception at the embassy
on Thursday night, Osipov told him to submit his list of questions and he would see
what they could do about getting him to Moscow to interview Khrushchev,
Jaffe said that he felt that the over-all trip by Khrushchev would be
beneficial, particularly in case of a hot war because Khrushchev, having seen the
country and the people, may hesitate before "pushing the button."

This morning Kemper took a call from Mr. Sam Jaffe,
CBS News--Television, New York, Plaza 1-2345, Extension 7801.
He wanted to know if it would be possible to interview the Director
in connection with the current juvenile delinquency problem in
New York City. Kemper told Jaffe that the Director had a firm
policy in not injecting himself into local matters; and accordingly,
the Director could not comply with this request.
:
Jaffe then wanted to know if it would be possible to
interview SAC Foster on the problem of juvenile delinquency, but
that this interview would be general in nature and would not refer
to the specific New York problem, but would cover the broad
national picture.
Kemper advised Jaffe that again it would be injecting
the FBI into the local situation, and we did not deem this advisable.
Jaffe agreed. Kemper called SAC Foster and alerted him to Jaffe's
call and explained to him the reasons. Foster said that he would be
alert to keeping out of the situation as it developed in New York.

Summary of Information Furnished During
Pertinent Period
Informant has continued to associate with numerous
Soviet and Satellite Nationals in NYC in connection with his
employment as a news reporter with the Columbia Broadcasting
System (CBS). He has had lunch with them, has attended
social affairs at their UN Delegations and at the UN and in
connection with his employment as a news reporter he has
been in touch with members of the Soviet Bolshoi Ballet
while it was in NY. He was also in contact with members of
the Soviet Fair Committee while they were in NY in connection
with the Soviet Exhibition of Science, Culture and Technology,
which was exhibited at the NY Coliseum.
During his contacts with Soviet and Satellite
Nationals informant has learned information about individuals,
Soviet and Satellite personalities, which he has passed on to
the Bureau. He has been able to ascertain some information
with respect to the travel of these individuals and in some
cases has been able to ascertain the reason for the return to
Russia of some Soviet Nationals.

the CBS received a letter from PETR BORISSOV in which BORISSOVC

offered to pay all of this employee's expenses while he
visited Russia, if this employee would pay his expenses
to Russia. Informant advised that this individual met
BORISSOV at the UN while BORISSOV was employed there in
the Department of Public Information. Since BORISSOV'S
return to Russia this employee was apparently in contact
with him according to informant. Informant got this in-
formation secondhand and was not able to furnish this
individual's name until 7/7/59. On 7/21/59
a Research Analyst on the staff of the CBS, appeared at the
NYO and furnished information concerning his association

with the individual about whom informant furnished informa-
tion and he is now being considered for development as an
informant or double agent. He is going to Russia.
(c)
* On 6/3/59, as a result of his contacts with
Soviet Nationals, informant was able to shed some light on
the rather sudden departure of VADIM BOGOSLOVSKI, Protocol
Officer at the Soviet UN Delegation. Through his contacts
among Soviet Nationals he learned that BOGOSLOVSKI was
having family troubles and on 8/11/59, he learned that
BOGOSLOVSKI did not expect to return to the US because of
these family troubles.
(c)
On 7/7/59, informant advised that IMRE HOLLAI,
-6
Counselor of the Hungarian Delegation to the UN, was
spending a vacation at Cape Cod in Massachusetts. HOLLAI
is a known Hungarian Agent and this was the first information
to come to the attention of this office concerning his
travel to Cape Cod. This information resulted in appropriate
investigation of HOLLAI in Cape Cod.

i. Informant's Potential for Advancement
Informant possesses good petential for advancement
in the Soviet and Satellite field. He is aggressive and very
capable of injecting himself into circles in which he has not
been acquainted in the past on the basis of his occupation
as a news reporter. To date, his acquaintance among Soviet
and Satellite Nationals has been widening continuously.
:
j. Stability and Reliability
:
Informant's association with Soviet Nationals has
(c)
been verified by sources of all types. The information he
has furnished concerning Soviet Nationals has on many oc-
casions been substantiated by information obtained from
other sources. To date, information furnished by informant
has been accurate and he has proved reliable in his dealings
with this office.
:
On
(C)
Informant has not shown any sign of instability.
He has, however, experienced marital difficulties during
the past 8 months, which have caused him great concern.
8/11/59, informant advised that his marital difficulties
have about been resolved and his wife will obtain a divorce
in the immediate future. Informant and his wife have reached.
an agreement in connection with their divorce.
k. Indoctrination Against Disclosure
Informant is most security conscious and has
repeatedly stated that if it became known that he was
furnishing information to the Bureau on a confidential
basis his career as a news reporter would be jeopardized.
Informant has been repeatedly advised of the necessity
for maintaining the fact that he is furnishing information
to the Bureau on a confidential basis in strictest confi-
dence in the interest of the Bureau as well as himself.

Informant's wife was briefly acquainted with the
Bureau's interest in the Soviets as this interest stems
from the Bureau's jurisdiction in matters involving the
internal security of the US. At the same time her attention
was called to recent publicity appearing in the "NY Herald
Tribune" about the Bureau's interest in the Soviets. She
was also told that the Bureau wanted to be sure that its
interest in the Soviets in no way interfered with the United
Nations in its efforts to achieve the very worthy aims and

Subject, Samuel Adason Jaffe, is Columbia Broadcasting

Soviets in official news-gathering capacity since 1951. He has written
articles for "The Nation." He was interviewed 9/12/58 and since that
date has been furnishing information concerning his contact with four known
Soviet-Satellite intelligence agents as well as other Soviet officials.

Subject has been having marital difficulties and has been
living apart from his wife since 1/30/59. On 7/7/59 subject advised

as soon as possible. Subject has also retained an attorney. Subject's
wife refused to agree to a property settlement and on 6/30/59 threatened
to tell the Soviets that subject is working with the FBI. Subject has
indicated that he is concerned about this in view of the adverse effect
it might have on his news career. Subject has been security conscious
and in his news gathering capacity has had numerous official contacts
with the FBI. Subject stated that his wife has knowledge of his contacts
with the Bureau and with the Soviets. She does not know that subject
has been furnishing information to the Bureau. Subject believes his
wife may be making idle threats or may be making this statement in
order to harm subject."
Subject is not involved in any intelligence operation. He
does furnish good information concerning plans and thinking of top.
Soviet personnel at the United Nations. The New York Office has
recommended that we continue contact with subject and not take steps
to contact subject's wife, subject having indicated that he does not
feel that his wij wife will carry out her threats. It is pointed out that
subject has good official reasons to contact both the Soviets and the
Bureau, and in view of his desire for security in connection with his
reporting career, it appears we can safely continue contact with him.

Informant advised that through her attorney, his

Informant has agreed to give his wife a divorce providing

On June 30, 1959, informant met his wife to discuss
the matter of a settlement. During this discussion,
informant's wife threatened to ruin informant at CBS (his
employer), tell his children that he married her for her
money when they grow up and to tell the Russians that he is
working with the FBI. Informant said that he considered
these to be idle threats on the part of his wife; however,
he was very concerned about the effect his wife's threats
would have on his career as a news reporter if she carried
them out. Informant pointed out that he is very anxious
to travel to Russia and China and possibly represent CBS in
one of these countries at some future time. He said that
he would never be permitted to travel to these countries if
his wife ever said anything to the Russians about his talking
to the FBI.

since at least 10/30/57, when he and a CBS camera crew
made a feature film in the NYO. Informant said that his
wife has been aware of the fact that he has been in
contact with the Bureau and that he has been in contact
with the Russians. However, she does not know that he
has been furnishing information to the Bureau about the
Russians on a continuing basis. Informant agreed that
she may have assumed that he is doing this or that her
threat to tell the Soviets that he is talking to the FBI
indicated she would do this even if it were not true, in
order to harm informant.
(c)
The voluntary aspect of informant's cooperation
was called to informant's attention, as well as the fact that
his cooperation must be on a strictly confidential basis at
all times. Informant acknowledges that this had been
repeatedly called to his attention. He was then asked
if he wanted to continue to furnish information to the
Bureau. Informant said that he has great respect for the
Bureau and he feels duty bound to continue to furnish
information to the Bureau about the Soviets. However, he
reiterated a statement he has made in the past to the effect
that he could not do anything other than furnish information.
(c)
Informant was told to bear in mind that he has
had open contacts with this office and if he ever has
occasion to explain his contacts with the Bureau, to do so
on the basis of his news reporting activities. It was also
suggested to informant that he refrain from bringing up the
threats made by his wife in conversation with her, particularly
the threat about telling the Russians he is talking to the
FBI.

This office recommends that contact be
continued with informant as he has furnished valuable
information and is himself very security conscious and
désirous of furnishing information to the Bureau.
Consideration has been given to contacting informant's
wife, however, this would only serve to confirm what she
appears to have assumed and might possibly add impetus
to the situation existing between informant and his wife.
Should informant's wife carry out any or all of her threats,
informant understands that his cooperation has been
voluntary and will continue to be voluntary. Informant is
of the opinion that his wife will not carry out her threats.

Jaffe
Informant was interviewed on 5/12/59 at which time
he advised that it is fairly certain that he and his wife
will be divorced and all possibilities of a reconciliation
have been exhausted. Informant presumes that his wife will
obtain the divorce in Reno, Nevada on a date as yet un-
determined. Informant does not anticipate any scandal in
connection with the divorce nor does he anticipate any
publicity unless it results from the inability of he and
his wife to resolve the problem of custody of their children.
During this interview, the informant advised that
ய
he is still desirous of travelling to Red China as a news
reporter and toward this end he has written to the Chinese
Legation in London and forwarded three copies of "Face of Red
China", a pamphlet prepared by CBS concerning a television
presentation of the same name. In reply, he received a letter C
from the Third Secretary of the Chinese Legation, who advised
him that he was forwarding two copies of "Face of Red China" to
Peking and he was reapplying for a visa for the informant.
This Bureau will be kept advised of developments
in these matters.

1959, at which time he advised that he completed reading
the article concerning the FBI in the October 18, 1958
issue of "The Nation". The informant said that he was
very unimpressed with the content of the article and
was, of course, well aware of the fact that it contained
a mass of untrue information.
However, the informant said that he was not
personally acquainted with FRED J.
and could not possibly be aware of

The informant did
express the opinion that COOK must have thought that an
article such as this would benefit him financially
although he does not know this to be true.
However, the informant said that the article
is indicative of the thinking of CAREY MC WILLIAMS,
Editor of, "The Nation", and "The Nation's" Publisher,

that MC WILLIAMS and KERSTEIN would publish any article
which attacked the Bureau, the House on Un-American
Activities Committee, and almost any other government
organization.

statement of cooperation from the informant. It
