Report lio. 314
5 May 1970
PRANCO-enters the office. They mention the incident that
happened last night at Barajas airport when the plane arrived
from Havana. A woman (Spanish) raised her unbrella and
threatened HORACIO, while a gusano kept hitting him. FRANCO
says that he hit five or six of the attackers real hard, and
that he thinks he really hurt one of them quite badly around
the face and head. Everyone was covered with blood.
:
A woman and a man come into the office and talk about the
incident (above) also. Then the girl says that she has come
to Spain to take a course in Alcala. It seems that the course
is connected with UNESCO. She will later go to the University
of Santander and on to Paris to take a course there. She says
she is a member of the Party, and wants to know how she is
going to maintain her contact here in Spain. RUIZ says that
they too are members, but that due to the difficulty of public
relations that it is a month and a half since they have had
a group meeting. He says that the work that they are doing
makes it difficult to carry on the Party life, but that never-
theless it is necessary to have group meetings to discuss the
members. She says that she would like to live in Madrid,
in a student residence, and commute to Alcala by car, or
PHALS/INM bus every day. Ruiz says that in this way it would be more
economical for her and she would have more contact with the
other students. She says that she would like to be in
some Spanish-American college to get acquainted with the students
there. RUIZ says she could be very useful to them with her
student connections, and that without interfering with her
studies she can also be helping Cuba. He highly recommends
that she get every thing she can, culturally during her stay in
Spain. He says that for very much she has read about museums
and historical and artistic places it is quite different seeing
them.
Ruiz asks her to leave her address at the embassy so that the
President of the Women's Federation of the Party can take
advantage of her being of use to them in one way or another.
Ruiz tells her that anything that might happen to her to come
to the embassy and let them know about it. He says there is
the danger that they will spy on her or follow her and that
there is the possibility of enemies getting close to her.
He says that everyone makes mistakes and that if she does to
let them know at once so that they can prevent the consequence,
and give her good advice.
:
He has been out of the office for a long time. At about 2:30 pm
he comes in with BARREDA and another person. Ruiz says that
he has to write to the Deputy Secretary (of Foreign Relations-?)
about the incident at Farajas airport. He is going to point out
the permissiveness of the police. He is going to point out
that the officials of the embassy were provoked by the others
