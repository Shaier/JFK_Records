Do you understand that, under the
Committee rules, that you have a right to receive a copy of
the statement you are going to give us at this deposition?
10
11
Mr. Shaw. I should hope so, to check it for accuracy.
Mr. Goldsmith. However, by virtue of the arrangement
12
13
that the Committee has worked out with the Central Intelligence
Agency, we have been asked to request of Agency employees that
they waive their right to receive a copy of the deposition
14
15
for their own retention.
By that, I mean we would certainly
16
be willing to grant you access to the deposition, to correct
17
it in any way necessary, but the Agency has requested that
18
we ask you to waive your right to receive an actualy copy of
19
the deposition.
20
Mr. Shaw. I have no problem with that.

Mr. Goldsmith.
Thank you..
For the record, I would like to say that the Committee's

mandate is to investigate the assassination of the President.

The scope of the mandate includes who killed the President,
was there a conspiracy?

You do not understand how the cover
arrangement would work between the Agency and the Department

Mr. Shaw.. I have never had anything to do with the
10
setting up of such cover. It would well be that there might

Mr.Shaw. No. I am under, at the present time, nominal

is concerned, resigned over there in 1973, I believe. At

the present time, I am paid by the Agency.

When you were working under cover, were

Mr... Goldsmith. When you were working with the State
Department in other than a nominal capacity, what was your
title?
Mr. Shaw. My last title was Special Assistant to the
Ambassador and First Secretary of Embassy, Honduras.
Mr. Goldsmith. Did you ever work as a consular officer?
Mr. Shaw. Yes, I did.
Mr. Goldsmith. When you worked as a consular officer,
were you required to fulfill both responsibilities as a con-
sular officer and as a CIA employee?
Mr. Shaw. To a certain extent.
For example, I have never issued a visa. I have issued
a passport for another consular officer who accepted the
application and I would be on the road in northwestern Mexico
and issued the passport to the American citizen concerned.

was an American citizen there, to find out what the story
was, why he was there, how he was being treated and that sort
of thing, and relay that information to the consular when I
got back.
Actually, I have not done much consular work. I used

Mr. Goldsmith. Normally when somebody is acting under
State Department cover, is the person required to hold down
two jobs at the same time?
Mr. Shaw. It depends on the location of the person.
As I understand it, people we have, for example, in the Iron
Curtain countries, or the countries of Eastern Europe, do
hold down virtually 100 percent full-time State Department,
Foreign Service jobs. Some of the people that I have run into
in my work as an Inspector for the Office of the Inspector
General, notably in the Mid-Eastern countries, have spent much
more time on their cover work than I did.
I think that it has to do basically with the permissive-
ness, or lack thereof, of the operational environment that
you are in. In Mexico, it was not necessary to spend much

the CIA's handling of the investigation of the Kennedy
assassination?

Mr. Shaw. None whatever.
Mr. Goldsmith. Has anyone ever interviewed you before
pertaining to the Mexico City situation as far as it pertained
to Oswald?
Mr. Shaw. Yes. It was about that time of '76, some-
body interviewed me in the CIA Headquarters building, and I
think it was a Senate Committee, but I amanot sure. They had
some files.
Mr. Goldsmith. Did you give your testimony under oath
at that time?
Mr. Shaw. No, not that I remember.
Mr. Goldsmith. Did any CIA person ever interview you
concerning Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico City and
the operations of the Mexico City station?
Mr. Shaw. I would have to qualify that. We discussed
the subject, of course, in Mexico City at the time of the
assassination, or immediately after the assassination.

and which subsequently turned out not to be a picture of
Oswald?
Mr. Shaw. I am familiar with a photograph that was
identified by people at the station in Mexico City as possibly
being an American-appearing person. I do not know that it

He also seemed to think rather highly of a former one-time
3
FBI agent named George Monroe.

Mr. Goldsmith.
What about David Phillips?
5
Mr. Shaw. Yes.
Dave Phillips ran the, what we called the

CA side of the shop, covert action, mostly propaganda.
I came
7
to Mexico City with the understanding that I was going to head
3
up the Cuban shop. Very soon after I arrived there, Dave
9
10
Phillips was tapped it was while we were still in the old
Embassy building.
11
12
He was tapped and named the new Cuban Office Chief.
Mr. Goldsmith. Did that happen in October '63?
13
Mr. Shaw. I don't know.
I do not remember. But it was
not too long after I was there, and I was asked, I think by
15
Dave; I don't remember -- if I had any objections to continuing
to serve in Cuba.

17
I liked Dave, I respected him. I did not feel that I
18
was being hurt, hurt careerwise, to step back and I was very
19
interested in Cuban operations, so I did willingly, let us say,

22
relinquish command, if you want to, of Cuban Ops and I served
Dave as one more officer.
Later on, after Dave left, a year or two later, I once

You were in charge of Cuban Operations at
25

Then Phillips took it over at some point and

Shaw.
Since it was not ratified to me upon my
arrival that I was, indeed, Chief of Cuban Ops, I simply con-
20
21
22
sidered myself to be one more case officer working against
the Cuban target. Our basic interest was in effecting pene-
trations of the Cuban government.
23
What we wanted most of all were effective penetrations
24
of the Cuban Embassy, the Cuban Intelligence Service, and some
25
possible line-in to their communications set-up.

tion to see my contact reports on meetings with LITAMIL-9.
Mr. Goldsmith. In light of that, do you know what infor-

Mr. Shaw. I do not recall, and I do not recall the
specifics of anything.
You may have something in your files

I do have the recollection of the sense of feeling on the

the Cuban Embassy after this assassination, that she probably
spoke about it. I do not know.
Mr. Goldsmith. What was the name of LITAMIL-7?
Mr.Shaw. I'd rather not give names.
(Discussion off the record.)
Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Shaw, in light of your response, I am
9
certainly aware of the sensitivity of this issue and of your
10 concern for sources and methods, and I would also make two
11
points. One is that under the letter, you are free of your
12 secrecy obligation.
At the same time, I am not about to rely
upon that letter to compel an answer out of you, because you
13
14
are here voluntarily today to help us. And, as I said, because
15
I understand your concern for a sensitive source in this case,
16
17
I am not going to ask you to state for the record the name of
either one of these individuals.
Mr. Shaw. May I say something at this point?
18
19
Mr. Goldsmith.
20
Yes.
Mr. Shaw. It is my understanding that both of these
21
people are, if they are still alive, are living in Mexico and
22
I do not want to be in a position of revealing a name which
23
could harm either of those people. I notice here that it says
24
Mr. Goldsmith.
You are referring now to the letter from
25
Mr. Carlucci?

Mr. Shaw. Yes.
"To provide the affected person the opportunity to

of this authorization, particularly to questions which are

asked."
I would like to get Frank Carlucci to tell me that I would
reveal two names of agents, if it is necessary --or you can
find out from the file, probably, who they are.

10
Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Shaw, I understand your position.
I want to make sure you understand mine. I am in no way
11
forcing you to reveal a name.
Once you had demonstrated a
12
reluctance to, then, as far as I was concerned, then the
13
matter was terminated.
14
Mr. Shaw. No problem?
15
Mr. Goldsmith.
I will say that we will pursue this by
16
contacting the appropriate people at the Agency.
17
Mr. Shaw.
I think if you requested the Agency for those
18
two names, it would probably produce them.
I wouldn't want to
19
be the guy to say it.
20
Mr.
Goldsmith.
I understand your position perfectly.
21
I hope you understand mine.
22
Mr. Shaw. I do.
23
Mr. Goldsmith. I would not want you to go back to the
Agency and say that the staff of this Committee attempted to
24
25
compel an answer out of you.

I will not say any such thing.

For the record, would you spell the cryptonyms of these

penetration agents?

Mr. Shaw. One of them was LITAMIL-7

The other was LITAMIL-9.

Mr. Goldsmith. Are these two agents still active?
Mr. Shaw. Neither one is active. I am quite sure that
neither one is active.
Mr. Goldsmith. For purposes of clarification, LITAMIL-7,
10
11
was that agent working out of the consulate?
12
13
Mr. Shaw. That agent was an employee of the consular
section of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City.
LITAMIL-9 was an
14
officer of the Embassy.
15
Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Shaw, on the question of the identity
16
of these two agents, when you go back to the Agency, could you
17
raise this question with the appropriate individual, appropri-
18

ate superior authority, and we will do the same so that some
time this week we can get together on that?
20
Mr. Shaw. I do not see any reason for us to get together.
