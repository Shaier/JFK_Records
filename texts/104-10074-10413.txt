4. On 8 December 1960 Jose Xavier CORTES Hernandez who represents himself as a
priest told Jose Antonio PORTUONDO Valdor, Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, that
he had information that "the thing they were working on" had gotten underway
and had produced a tremendous reaction in Cuba.2 He said that a friend, who
is Roman Catholic but very liberal, had returned from a visit to Cuba, where
he said the Knights of Columbus were pretty well entrenched. For this reason,
CORTES said he felt it would be necessary to "take the bull by the horns" and
begin things or the Knights of Columbus would gain the advantage.
2. PORTUONDO said that the bombing of the church of Father BOZA in Cuba had
definitely been an act of "auto-agression" and was clumsily done. He said a
red flag with hammer and sickle was found in the debris. PORTUONDO told CORTES
that-Carlos OLIVARES, Under-secretary of Foreign Affairs, had not gaid any-
thing, but, since he, PORTUONDO, was going to Cuba at the end of December, he
believed that OLIVARES would wait until his visit: 3

were going.
