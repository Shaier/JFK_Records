01 1. During a recent training period on interrogation with
a HUGLIB Case Officer, the point of getting information from
suspects on their international contacts or information that
might help other services was stressed. Apparently, as a result,
the HUGLIB Case Officer dug into his notes on the interrogation
of Ricardo Ismael VALLECILLO Perez, Guatemalan FAR member, and
came up with the following information which he thought WOFIRM
might want to pass to the Mexican Ser
xican Service 24
2. VALLECILLOS stated (the Interrogation took place in
December, 1967) that FAR was awaiting the arrival of new type
machine-pistol called the Red Star (Estrella Roja) from Cuba.
He stated that it was a 28 shot weapon and would be issued to
commanders of Guerrilla Groups to replace the present Browning
semi-autos.
He then added that the individuals in charge of
shipping weapons and money to the FAR were two officials of the
Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. Their names are Alfredo MIRAMBAL
Diaz and Adelo (or Abeldo) CALOME Ibarra. The HUGLIB) officer
stated that VALLECILLOS blurted this information out in reply
to a sarcastic remark made by the Case Officer about the
efficacy of the FAR gun-running mechanism.
the
3. HUGLIB-100 has given this permission to pass this infor-
mation to the Mexican Service if it is considered of any value
by WOFIRM.
