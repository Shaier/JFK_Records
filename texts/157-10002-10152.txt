Papich began with a brief summary of his experi-
ence in the FBI. During World War II and there-
after he ran certain operations in Latin America.
In 1945-47, he ran counterintelligence operations
in Brazil against the Communist Party of Brazil
and bloc intelligence agents. In 1952 he became
FBI liaison with CIA charged with coordinating
and planning, including the development of sources.
He also had special assignments overseas for Hoover.

is no estimate of how many Soviet illegals are in
the United States. The old view was that illegals
would aim at middle-class government and business
positions. It has been discovered that they take
jobs like dishwasher to develop an employment
background. There is no knowledge of Soviet
objectives. Illegals may do nothing for years so
they can be tapped for the future. There may be
100, 500, or 5,000 of them. Some were sent in as
early as the 20's and 30's. They are the Rudolph
Abel-type.
His network was never identified.
Therefore, Papich is clearly unhappy with U. S.
results in identifying Soviet operations in the
United States.

Papich stated that he played a controversial
"devil's advocate" role between the FBI and the
CIA. He did not confer with Attorney General
Mitchell after Helms called his name to Mitchell's
attention. Papich assumes Helms wanted Mitchell
to get a review of the history of FBI-CIA relations.
Papich would not have gone to Mitchell without
checking with other FBI officials.

To understand decisions in 1966 or 1970 it is
necessary to go back to World War II, according
to Papich. President Roosevelt got the FBI into
the foreign intelligence field in World War II.

couldn't do that with foreign police. A foreign
intelligence service cannot operate like a domestic
intelligence agency.

In 1952, when Papich became FBI-CIA liaison, rela-
tionships between the agencies were a mess. Beedle
Smith was CIA director. There were many flaps
between FBI and CIA over CIA political and psycho-
logical warfare, especially regarding the funding
of labor groups, student groups, and political
parties. At the time of the 19 1947 Act, these tech-
niques of "covert action" were the subject of
tremendously heated battles between CIA and State.
There were fewer flaps in the counterintelligence
field.

In the field of political and psychological warfare
operations, the CIA didn't want stereotyped people.
The CIA was not disciplined and ignored jurisdictional
agreements.

possible assignment, the newsman would contact
the FBI to ask what was going on, this would go
to Hoover, who would raise hell with the CIA
director. But Beedle Smith was tough. Communi-
cation between the FBI and CIA was almost non-
existent by 1952.

Papich had no CIA counterpart since the CIA is
so compartmented. He had contacts at all levels,
exchanging ideas for operations. He would push
CIA ideas in the FBI. Flaps would come up. He
would stamp them out and say "get on with the job".

Tolson
Hoover never
expressed a desire to give up his intelligence
job. Nobody, including Tolson, knew Hoover's
reasons for doing what he did. He had his own
conversations and contacts in the White House,
Congress, and his personal sources. He knew what
he was doing and had "a nose and ear for the
political climate in Washington". This was true
for "risky" operations.

Papich believes it would be disastrous to give
both foreign and domestic intelligence duties to
a CIA. While there would be advantages in
coordinating fragmented sources, it is a risk to
liberty, like a national police.

Papich did not recall any significant plan to
improve coordination in 1958 when FBI joined USIB.
FBI was part of the USIB predecessor group.

The CIA would suggest joint field operations but
Hoover would rarely buy it. This was like his
reluctance to join any operation with any other
agencies. He thought the FBI should always have
control, a commanding role. For example, Allan
Dulles discussed the United Nations with Hoover.

Friction would develop in "the gray area" of posi-

the CIA of the results upon the informant's return.

The FBI liaison section was made up of six or seven
agents. Papich and Bill Creager handled the CIA.
Creager dealt specifically with USIB, the Security
Committee, the Interagency Defector Committee, and
the Office of Security. Papich and Creager backed
each other up in their respective areas. There
were several liaison agents at the Pentagon. The
liaison at State was Oren Bartlett. The other
liaison agents were not so deeply involved in in-
telligence operations as was Papich. FBI liaison
at NSA was Bill McDonnell, although Papich was also

INTERVIEW AND MEETING SUMMARY
Regarding FBI service and support to other agencies,
Hoover was "goddamned careful". He was sensitive
to any "risks" and thus any request for FBI support
had to be established firmly. Hoover never
responded "let them do it" within the United
States. Hoover did not give other agencies any
blessing or approval for questionable domestic
activities such as the case of the Bolivian official
mentioned above.

In both the FBI and the CIA, Papich stimulated
interest in covering and recruiting people in

There were flaps in the 1950's when the CIA
recruited without clearing with the FBI. The CIA
asked for FBI wiretapsino more than five or six
times. Papich was asked by FBI officials whether
the CIA ever went to the Attorney General directly
for wiretap authority. Papich says this may have
happened, but not to his knowledge. Few Attorneys

possibility with McCone and Robert Kennedy, where
the relationship was unusually close. Papich says

for it. The FBI as constad did not have
trained personnel or capability to develop foreign
targets. The CIA had this capability. Papich
proposed that FBI permit CIA to recruit in the
United States. CIA would advise FBI of its interest
in a target, the purposes of the contact, and any
results. If the FBI had no interest in the target,
that is, an interest in a KGB contact for example,
it would OK the CIA contact. FBI required that
CIA furnish it any information relevant to its
needs, that is regarding KGB contacts (the New Left
was handled separately from the memorandum of under-
standing procedures).

Alan Belmont headed the FBI Intelligence Division
before Sullivan. A capable administrator, he
operated behind the scene, stayed out of politics,
had good rapport with agents, and was able to
handle Hoover. When Belmont retired, the FBI "lost
a rudder". This was a crucial point in FBI history,
with Hoover getting old. Belmont stressed to his
subordinates the need to develop a strong case for
any proposal going to Hoover. Once that case was
ready, Belmont would push it hard, but Papich and
Belmont did disagree on such matters as counter-
intelligence operations against the KGB.

Regarding the CIA and domestic dissidents, in
the 50's the CIA's general attitude was not to
investigate or surveil Americans overseas. FBI-
CIA communications rarely involved U. S. citizen
targets unless they clearly involved a KGB agent.
In the 1960's, Papich recalls two early incidents

was the Republic of New Africa, a black group
with contacts with Communists and foreign radicals
(note by Elliff the individual was Robert
Williams?). The second was Stokely Carmichael, who
traveled around the world. The FBI asked the CIA
for coverage of Carmichael's contacts overseas
but there were no results since the CIA had no
capability. In retrospect, Papich thinks his
importance was exaggerated.

Papich does not recall any case or interest of the
CIA regarding Dr. King. The FBI levied no requests
on the CIA regarding Dr. King. Papich recalls that

was not a CIA priority. CIA was satisfied with FBI
coverage of the Communist Party. If the KGB was
using it for espionage or influence, the FBI would
uncover it. The FBI would inform CIA of CPUSA
activities. Regarding CPUSA, FBI determined that
there was Soviet financial support into the 1960's.
The FBI attitude as early as the 50's was that the
CIA did not have the capability to discover CPUSA
links to the Soviet Union. There were no leads for
the CIA to explore in France, Czechoslovakia, etc.
If a Communist Party member went to Rome or London,
then FBI would ask CIA coverage, but the CIA gave
it low priority and produced little. This led to
FBI dissatisfaction with CIA, so FBI went through
its legal attaches, who would contact foreign
security services. Normally, the CIA was informed
but sometimes the CIA was not notified if the FBI
called it "an internal security" matter. Papich

Regarding the legal attaches, Papich was in Rio
de Janerio after World War II. The FBI had moved
out when the CIA moved in, but Hoover wanted to
have someone there anyway. Papich stayed a year
but wanted out since he disliked doing only
liaison work with local police and CIA. The legal

There were six or seven legal attache offices
from the 1950's until Papich left in 1970. Papich
feels that if the FBI has legal attaches they should
be closely coordinated with the CIA so that their
assets and sources do not duplicate the CIA.
FBI man abroad can be useful to the intelligence
community through his liaison with local police.
Coverage in the counterintelligence field of a
Soviet officer should be by the CIA. Coverage of
a CPUSA member should be joint FBI-CIA. There
never has been such coordination. The legal
attache should be involved in operations through
his liaison contacts.

Papich sees the implications of this for the need
to have a single counterintelligence agency. There
would be advantages of centralization, communication,
and security.

When the legal attache asks a foreign intelligence
service for coverage of an FBI target, it asks for
any information rather than specifying the data.
This is because foreign services may be penetrated
by the KGB.

Regarding the CIA investigations of U.S. citizens,
Papich recalls beginning to request CIA coverage
of New Left travel abroad about 1967. He does not
recall an FBI interest as early as 1965, at the
time of the Hoover meeting at the White House on
antiwar protests.

Papich did not know of the 1967 White House request
to CIA nor did he know when Ober's unit was set up.
He had no discussion with Ober on setting up his
unit but he did know of its existence after it was
established. The FBI was asking CIA about particular
group leaders. The Bureau wanted to know if there
was foreign money or guidance to antiwar leaders.
These requests were directed to Ober (Papich did not
know CIA project codewords). There was no CIA

Moscow. The CIA's attitude toward this new issue
was similar to the old assumptions about the CPUSA.

SECRET

INTERVIEW AND MEETING SUMMARY
Page 12 of 21

The accepted view at CIA was that it was impor-
tant to determine if there was foreign support or
sabotage training. After 1967, FBI-CIA contacts
on this topic developed rapidly. There were few
really valuable CIA results nor was much obtained
through the FBI, the legal attaches, or informants
going abroad.

Papich referred to the climate of press commentary,
assassinations, allegations of sabotage plans, and
bombings. There was "a potential for panic within
the intelligence community" since no one had the
coverage they thought they needed. Travel of U.S.
antiwar leaders to Communist nations seemed impor-
tant, although sometimes after inquiry the individuals
were found not to be important. Therefore, time was
spent on targets who should not have been targets
but this was a new task.

Hoover did not understand the issue. He thought
New Left CPUSA links were most important. Papich
never thought the CPUSA responsible for development
of the New Left or SDS. CPUSA did try to use the
New Left. Hoover assumed the Soviets controlled
CPUSA day to day.
Some of his assumptions had
been proved wrong. In World War II days, yes,
the Soviets used CPUSA for recruitment. In the
late 40's and 50's, the Soviets changed their
policy, no longer using CPUSA for this purpose.
Hoover was never convinced of this change. Papich
recognized the possibility that there might be a
reversal of Soviet policy regarding CPUSA but
Papich's top concern has always been KGB penetra-
tion of CIA, FBI, NSA, etc., as well as the question
of how good the double agents are.

Regarding the theory of KGB aims) for using U.S.
dissidents, the main problem was lack of knowledge.
In the 40's and 50's, the FBI was confident of its
knowledge of CPUSA and could assess its use to
influence U. S. politics, but in the late 50's
the Bureau's coverage of new groups was tremendously
weak. The FBI recognized this. The CIA stressed
it also for three reasons: (1) the increase in FBI
requests for CIA information, (2) the White House
requests, and (3) CIA officials own concern about
inadequate coverage. The conclusion was that
intelligence regarding people who went abroad was
inadequate.

INTERVIEW AND MEETING SUMMARY
Papich had no personal involvement with White
House requests. There was discussion both in the
FBI and between CIA and FBI on expanding coverage
and development of sources. For example, does
CIA have anybody who can have an entree into SDS?
The Katzenbach report had limited the CIA to
foreign sources or to U. S. students recruited
abroad. Papich dealt mainly with Ober on this,
but also with Angleton and Tom Karamenses (DDP).
Papich believes anything Ober said and did

acted alone. No one has nswered the question
of what Oswald did in the Soviet Union. Did he
get any guidance? Why did they permit him to
leave? Papich had frequent discussions with
Dulles and the CIA regarding the Warren Commission
although he thinks the formal FBI liaison was Jim
Malloy. The question as to whether Oswald was a
U. S. intelligence asset never arose. Critics at
the time said the FBI should have surveilled
Oswald. Papich recalls discussions of a plan to
have a CIA or FBI man defect to Moscow but no such
plan was ever implemented to his knowledge.
It was
not worth the risk. He does not know whether the
CIA did it. He stresses that the FBI was not likely
to use "nuts".

Regarding the Riha incident, Papich says this was
not the reason for his retirement. Instead, there
were problems with Hoover on operations and policy
decisions. Papich was taking an aggressive stand
on coverage of Sovlots. (S)

Regarding McCone's proposal on expanded FBI cover-,
age of Soviets Papich stated that others in the
CIA influenced McCone to press for more coverage.
McCone was aggressive. Papich pushed it too.
This was the time of the Cuban missile crisis.

INTERVIEW AND MEETING SUMMARY
Hoover would agree to expand on certain issues
but proposals for major new operations went to
PFIAB for support. Clifford was chairman. Papich
doesn't know what Hoover said to Clifford, but the
answer on the proposal was negative. The proposal
involved more extensive and sophisticated elec-
tronic surveillance. This was at the time of dis-
covery of microphones in the U. S. Embassy in
Moscow, as well as an increase in the number

saw the FBI as

that FBI had to reject CIA proposals as illegal.
When Papich lectured to CIA recruits he attempted
to orient CIA to the FBI's limits. On the other
hand, FBI did not understand CIA functions abroad.

Returning to the Riha incident, Papich stressed
that he clashed with Hoover every year and that
their relationship had declined steadily after
1966. By fall of '69, he saw his value as nil.
In December '69, he decided to retire the follow-
ing. spring. In February 1970, while winding up
his normal business, the Riha incident arose.
Professor Riha disappeared from the university.
There was faculty and press interest in Boulder,
Colorado, and a Congressional inquiry came to FBI.
But FBI opened no case or investigation. In March
of 1970 the president of the University of Colorado
came to a CIA man in domestic contact service in
Boulder to inquire about the disappearance. The
CIA man called two friends in the Denver FBI office.
FBI agent agreed to contact Denver police and dis-
covered that marital problems had led to the dis-
