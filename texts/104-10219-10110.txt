CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20505
MEMORANDUM FOR: Director
National Security Agency
SUBJECT
1 William H. MARTIN
Succe a
25 JAN 1968
1. On 15 January 1968 this Agency received the
following information from our liaison contact in the
Canadian Department of State for External Affairs:
a. The Canadian Press Correspondent in Moscos,
William BUCKLEY, approached our Embassy informally in the
niodle of December on behalf of Filliam MARTIN, the
ex-employee of NSA who defected to the Soviet Union in 1960.
b. According to BUCKLKY, MARTIN wishes to see his
parents for compassionate reasons and wants to know if he
would be admitted to Canada without fear of extradition to
the United States if he were to arrange a rendez-vous with
his parents in Vancouver. We do not know whether HARTIN
still has a United States passport or whether he has become
a Soviet citizen. In any event MARTIN considers himself
inadmissible to the United States.
c. BUCKLEY met MARTIN at the apartment of
Howard RAUSCH, the Moscow correspondent for McGraw-Hill
Publications. In addition KARTIN later telephoaed BUCKLEY
to indicate his interest in finding out whether or not he
could cose to Canada. EUCKLEY assumes, quite rightly I
would think, that the manner in ebica MARTIN has made his
request indicates that his Russian hosts are avare of his
interest in getting out of the Soviet Union to see his parents.
d. We have informed our imbassy that it should
take no action to encourage BUCKLEY OF MARTIN to believe that
a visa vould be granted if MARTIN were to make formal
application. Since, however, KARTIN's interest in coming to
Canada is already in a newspaperman's hands, we cannot rule
out the possibility that BUCKLEY aight write about KARTIN's
interest. Such a story would probably lead to the need for
an expression of the Canadian Government's attituse. In
making recommendations on the kind of response that might be
made in the event that a question is put to ay Minister, it

Fou! coas oviul to know what BARTIá's status in law is
so far as the United States is concerned. If, for examplo,
your Government could not take legal action, the Canadian
authorities would be in a position if this matter came to
public attention to say that they were not avare of any
barrier preventing MARTIN from seeing his parents in the United
States. I should be most grateful if through your channels
Be could be provided informally with an indication of
MARTIN's status in law in the United States.
.. BUCKLEY's only other comment on MARTIN was that
he didn't really know what to make of MARTIN. MARTIN
Beened outspoken in dealing with the shortcomings of life
in the Soviet Union. On the other band he spoke with a
elight stammer and seemed nervous. BUCKLEY'S view for what
it is vorth is that MARTIN is not interested in getting into
trouble with the Russians or coing anything which they might
consider underhanded. I should emphasize that no member of
the Canadian Embassy has had any direct contact with MARTIN,
2. On 18 January 1968 the Fedoral Bureau of Investigation
vas advised of the foregoing informally, in order to explore
the possibility of providing an indication of Subject's
status in law, as requested in paragraph 1. d. above.
3. This Agency was advised by the Department of State
on 19 January that Subject's parents had writtes to the
Department advising that Subject would like to visit his
parents, that he was planning a visit to Canada, and
inquiring what Subject's legal position vould be if he did
indeed visit. The Department indicated that it planned to
inquire what the U. 5. Embassy in Moscow knew of Subject's
travel plans, including a check with the Canadian Babassy to
ascertain if subject had applied for a visa. The Department
vas apprised of the informal Canadien inquiry as to Subject's
status, but indicated that it would refrain from making anу
reference to this inquiry in seaxing information from the
U. 8. Esbassy in Moscow.
4. Our representative in Ottawa was apprised of the
developseats cited in paragraph above, and requested to
pass then on to the liaison contact, on 19 January 1968.
