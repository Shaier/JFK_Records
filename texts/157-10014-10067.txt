Mr. Baron. Mr. Tweedy, are you aware that you have
the right to cease answering questions at any time and

TESTIMONY OF BRONSON TWEEDY
Mr. Tweedy. I came aborad the Agency in the first of
12
May, 1947 and after training was sent to Switzerland.
13
returned in 1950 and did a series of desk jobs in what was know
14-
:
as the Central European Division, I guess, and went through
15
16
a number of different assignments at that time, until May
15-14
of 1953 when I went out as Chief of Station to Vienna, Austris
17
1
I was there until the middle of 1956 and returned very
15-1
briefly to the States, went to dondonas Deputy Chief of
19
1000、
بانه
Station there. I took over as Chief of Station there in the
middle of 1958 and was then replaced by Frank Wisner, in
15-1
London early in October 1959, and I took over the
22
African Division I should think somewhere around between the
15th and 18th of November 1959.
24
That brings me up to date.

Mr. Baron. In that position did you consult frequent
with people in policy-making positions at the State Department?
Mr. Tweedy. Well, as I was explaining to you as we
were strolling around, the simple answer to that is yев.
These consultations would take many, many different forms.
On the Congo, for example, the State Dapartment
obviously was just as involved as practically the rest of the
U.S. Government and they had a Congolese task force. I
would attend their meetings or a representative of mine would
attend their meetings. They took place almost daily,
13
sometimes I guess even more than once daily.
14
15
Mr. Baron. During what period of time?
Mr. Tweedy.
16
17
Oh, Lord, from the time the Congo thin;
really hotted up, and I am talking then particularly under the
Kennedy Administration, when Mennen Williams organized the
1

task force and Wayne Fredericks was his deputy; those meet-
ings were State's meetings, they weren't CIA meetings, they
weren't meetings primarily to discuss the CIA policy, but

we had to be there to maintain, to keep abreast of what the
policy was.
Mr. Baron. If we could focus our attention on the
period between the independence of the Congo in June of '60
and the announcement of the death of Lumumba in February of 1.

As you know, there is a lot of mystery surrounding his
death and the probable cause of his death. AS far as the U..
investigation was concerned it was January 17 or perhaps
January 18, 1961.
Mr. Tweedy. Yes.

Mr. Baron. It was during the Kennedy Administration
that the large scale paramilitary operations in the Congo were
geared up.
Mr. Tweedy. All that happened then, absolutely.
Mr. Baron.
Do you remember discussions with Livingstone
Merchant in the State Department before the turn of Adminis-
trations?
Mr. Tweedy. I knew Livingstone Merchant but specific
discussions with him I really do not recall, no.
Later on
I remember having a couple of meetings along with Mr. Rusk.
Mr. Baron. Did any of those meetings concern Lumumba?
Mr. Tweedy. No, Mr. Rusk, I think they exclusively
concerned Portuguese Africa.
Mr. Baron. Do you remember having any meetings alone
with Herter, Secretary llerter, about Lumumba?
Mr. Tweedy. I am not sure I have had a meeting with Mr.
Herter.
Dr. Baron. Did you have any meetings with Secretary
Horter or Douglas Dillon or Livingstone Perchant?
Mr. Tweedy. Never met Mr. Dillon.

Mr. Baron. When you met regularly with Mr. Satterswate
or Mr. Penfield did you discuss Lumumba with them?
Mr. Tweedy. I am sure we discussed Lumumba in the
sense of which would be all the time, assessing the situa-
tion, assessing where Lumumba was heading, where the Congo
was heading.
I did this with, you know, almost all of the
African situations, individual African country situations.
We would spend a great deal of time, their points of
view, our point of view, cur perspective, their perspective,
but never as an action matter that I can recall.
Mr. Baron. Was the assassination of Patrice Lumumba
ever contemplated or raised in those meetings?
Mr. Tweedy.
Never.
Mr. Baron. Did you meet regularly in this period
between Congolese independence and the announced death of
Lumumba with people at the NSC level or people in the White
House?

Mr. Tweedy. I don't recall so at all. For example, if
