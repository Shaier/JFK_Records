ACTION REGLUREFIRICIS
OHAY CUANTEONS
1. Osvaldo GARCIA who arrived in Spain nearly two
months ago to supervise the production of two-burner stoves
being manufactured by the Spanish firm Tallers Cataluna, S. A.
(TACA) (TACA is also manufacturing the 10,000 cane wagons for
the Cubans), passed through Madrid on 23 September and told
AMAUTO-1 that there was an unidentified Cuban in Zaragoza
who is preparing a study on Spanish firms trading with Cuba.
AMAUTO-1 immediately suspected that this Cuban was an agent
of RVROCK and suggested that GARCIA got to know this person
and try to elicit biographic information as well as attempt
to get a photograph of him for possible identification.
2.
Station has no idea who this Cuban might be.
