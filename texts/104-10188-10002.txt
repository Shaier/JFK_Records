Form 124 dated 22 November 1966
1.
In accordance with Reference, Subject was granted
an QA on 22 November 1966 to permit the WII/7/Haiti Desk to
utilize Subject as a Creole translator of unclassifiod tapes,
Subject was recruited in December 1966 and has been per-
forming this function satisfactorily since that time.
2. It is now requested that Subject's OA be amended
to permit WH/7/Haiti Desk to utilize his services to trans-
late sensitive telephone tapes (LIFEAT) from the Spanish,
French and Creole languages into English. To date the
Hexico City Station has been providing Headquarters with
a translation of the Spanish and French portions of this
intelligence take, with Port-au-Prince Station assisting
with translation of the Creole portions. Recently, however,
the Port-au-Prince asset departed Haiti and, at present,
neither Station has the capability to translate the Creole
portions. Since it is believed that the Creole portion may
contain important operational information from a CI stand-
point, the Haiti Desk proposes to utilize Subject to fulfill
this gap. Subject will be polygraphed before he is given
this added task. Your expeditious attention to the above
request would be appreciated.
3. If you desire further information, please call
Ruth Lehman, Wii/7/Haiti, x5595.

The salaries listed for LIFEUD in the project renewal

oral commitment which we have on file, and in some instances
(LIFEUDS 7, 8 and 9) the salaries are almost doubled. Would
you please verify for us that the salaries as submitted
