2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
3/8/61
To: Mr. Jack Kennedy
WH/4/Security
Mr. Kennedy,
in-
Several months ago I wrote you a letter concerning the Fro-Castro centi-
ments of
ants of Court Wood, son of Foster Wood, a local attorney. Since that time I've
seen Court only once, on March 3,1961, a and he appears to be actively engaged
in the organisation sation of a local chapter of the FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE
Complete with beard, Court has has been meeting with"Interested groups"and lect-
uring to students in sever eastern cities. He specifically mentioned Palimore,
Philadelphia, and New York. Apparently there are a number of students envolv
ed in this activity; I met David Lacterman from George Mason High School in
Falls Church, Va.and Walt MacDonwald, a fellos student of Courts, and both
are obviously active.
What action, if any, should I take in regard to my relationship with
Court and his father?
Please include this statement in my permanent record.
THANK YOU
Mchael Stratton
WH/4/Reg.
