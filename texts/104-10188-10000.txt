1. Station fully agrees with Headquarters concerning the value of
concentrating LIFEAT or LIENVOY coverage on suspected and/or known
Soviet, Satellite and Cuban agents residing in Mexico City. The Station
in the past has undertaken this type coverage and will continue such
coverage in the future as LIFEAT and LIENVOY facilities become avail-
able for assignment to these targets. As Headquarters is aware, this Station
can and will cover any possible target Headquarters considers of high
enough priority to cover.
2. For example, Carmen BRUFAU Civit was covered for 1956, 1957,
1960 and 1961; the results were not considered of sufficient value to continue
the coverage.
3. Presently, Elena VASQUEZ Gomez, one of the persons referred
to in reference, works for General Lazaro CARDENAS del Rio, pro-
Communist former President of Mexico. Coverage of CARDENAS by
LIENVOY means a certain amount of coverage of VASUEZ Gomes.

(Audio Operation)
1. FI/INT files contain 37 positive information
disseminations attributed wholly or in part to Project LIFEAT
during the year 1 July 1961 through June 1962. They were concerned
principally with contacte between Maxican Communists or leftists
and Cubans or individuals of the Soviet Eloc, and with the travel
of Latin Americans to the Soviet Bloc and Cuba. Six reports of
particular interest consisted of information on Transcontinental S.A.,
a company allegedly engaged in the illegal transshipment of US goods
to Cuba. Other reports of significance dealt with the contacts and
activities of former Guatemalan President Juan Jose AREVALO Barmeja,
now living in Mexico. There was reporting on Kicaraguan and Spanish
exile activity in Mexico and on the revolutionary sentiment and
expectations of other Latin American nationals.
2. LIFEAT has provided positive intelligence of value and of
relevance to customer requirements and to objectives of the PNIO.
It has been pointed out in the renewal request that the production
of positive information is incidental to the projects primary function
as a support and CI/CE operation.
3. RENEWAL IS RECOMMENDED.
