Dear Jerry:

Wish to thank you for your personal concern
and satisfactory solution obtained in the finan-
cial settlement of my case.

I consider it a privilege to have worked with
you, cooperating in a small way to preserve De-
mocracy in the Republic of Congo.

If I can ever be of service to the United
States -beloved country of my ancestors- I would
consider. it a high honor.

Do let me hear from you and feel sure that I
am your devoted friend.

Sincerely,

MEMORANDUM TO: Chief/KUCURL/HENGEN
20 August 1965
FROM : Edward W. LORENTZ
SUBJECT : Eduardo Whitehouse
REFERENCE : Dir-35418

1. Edward W. LORENTZ met with Eduardo Whitehouse on 17 August
1965, relative to finalizing the Whitehouse claim for monies still
due from his previous contract. LORENTZ emphasized that he was
authorized to pay monies due per contract through 7 April 1965,
plus a four day layover in Rome during Whitehouse's return to the
"U.S. This layover was due a Panam strike of which Whitehouse was
4.inadvertently delayed through no fault of his own.

2. The aforegoing authority is based on ref and calculated
as follows:

A. Base Pay for March - USD 800.

B. Base Pay 7/30 for April - USD 186.66
plus USD equivalent of USD 41.00 for actual expenses
while 2 days in Rome.

C. Total USD 1027.66.

3. Whitehouse although feeling that he should be allowed the
full amounts due amounting to USD 1950.00 has accepted such adjud-
ication of his claim. LORENTZ feels that possibly he was suffic-
iently satisfied that he received any funds, that probably in his
sense of fair play that the case might be considered closed. For
the record, what medical treatment received by Whitehouse amounted
to under USD 200. Το further complete the record the following
attachments are enclosed:

A. Letter from Dr. Elkhoury.

B. Second letter from Whitehouse to Jack
Anderson, Leop.

C. Letter from Whitehouse to LORENTZ.

D. Bills of actual charges in Rome.

Ε. Receipt from Whitehouse for final payment.

F. Station memo concerning newspaper inquiry.
C20AUG-65
201-300614

4. Less than 24 hours after facing Whitehouse to advise him
that his claim of USD 1950 had been reduced to 1027.66, Whitehouse
reacted with the newspaper media in an exemplary manner when he
could have reacted with a adverse feeling. The Subject despite
difficulties encountered in the field with KUBARK advisors appears
to be man of honor and certainly under controlled situations ASA
professional pilot and could be an asset to KUBARK interests.

Mr. Jerry Sounders
1.C Box 231
Miami Int. Agor
Xiami, Fia.
Dear Mr. Sounders:

Miami, Fle. Ausust 13 19:5

Three months have passed by since my return from
Leopoldville and as I explained to you in our rast
meetings, the amounts corresponding to the basic tay
of of March, Arcil and up to the 13th of May, when
my contract expired- are still unpaid therefore lea-
ving an outstanding balance of $1950.00 in my favor.

Although I appreciate your concern in this case,
I wish to informe about certain facts concerning
zy work in the Congo that will ex lain how every cent
of the mentioned ancunt was earned.

When pilot Fausto Gomez was shot doun near Sunia
-Dec. 17th 1964- that Air Base became paralized as
two of the pilcas resigned and the only one remaining
was ready to leave. Every one refused to take charge
of the Bunia Base beeruse of the proximity of the re-
bels, dangerous terrain, living conditions below stan-
dards, improper food, etc. Under these adverse circums-
tances I accepted the position of Chief Pilot and left
the confortable quarters of Stanleyville. Arrived to
Bunia Dec. 25th 1967 and next day reasumed full air
of erations against the rebels flying two and three mis-
sions per day as squadron leader with now unexperienced
pilots. These pilots did not have shooting, combat ma-
navering instruction, therefore I instructed then and
also in Dead Reckoning, instrument flying, etc. We hit
the enemy day by day Scrcing them to retreat to the ve-
ry border of Northeast Congo. M. Godofrcid. Munengo -1-
nister of the Interior- personally congratulated us for
our accomplishements in behalf of the Congo.

When I became 111, due to improper food, parasites,
etc.. I was ordered back to Lecpoldville for medical
treatment. Unable to recover and having lost 25 pounds,
Dr. Elki.cury suggested żę return to Mani for a more a-
dequate treatment. Fhotostatic copy of certificate are
attached. Loft Leopoldville April 3 1965 with the un-
derstanding that zy contract was not being cancelled.
I sincerely believe that my work and dedication thro-
ughout the entire campaing in Fortheast Congo deser-
ved the full payment of the mentioned contract.

Your consideration to this matter would be açırecia-
ted.

Sincerely,
E. J. 17:1itehouse

1. As we both know the Whitehouse case has been kicked around
sufficiently that the finalizing of the case should be effected as
soon as possible. My trip with Larry Murphy to Dow Leutcher's office,
: in my estimation didn't produce any effective decision. Mr. Leutcher's
point of view was, if the man was due the money, pay him. If he was not.
due the money, don't pay him. I will give you the facts as I see them
and if you feel that it is prudent to seek the advice of Jack Anderson
for his opinion I'm sure it will be most helpful.

to cover what he considered evacuation flight plus PAA on strike.

5. LEOP-8117 dated 7 April, allowed Perez to depart 8 April and one

8. WAVE-0832 dated 16 April, gave medical evaluation which was
reviewed by WAVE Medical personnel. (Opinion in debriefing of Sub-
ject I was personally convinced this man was sick. Furthermore. (W)
advised that he is in possission of medical report by Dr. El Khorury
that it was manditory for (W) to be evacuated for adequate medical
treatment.

9. WAVE-k457 dated 3 May, indicated (W) still under going
continuous medical treatment.

10. On April 19, (W) signed our local Quit Claim Form, but recent
conversation with the Subject indicated that he felt that although the
Form was signed that the "company would live up to its promises".

11. There is no doubt that (W) was ill and based upon medical
opinion, as late as 7 May, in my personal observation that the man was
Ancompatiated from performing a full time job that based upon the fact
that no definitive or written agreement was made prior to departure,
that the Subject be paid in full for the six months term of his contract.
(Opinion there is know doubt in my mind that this man firmly believes
that he is entitled to the salary based strictly upon the fact that he
was "evacuated" not terminated.

12. I don't feel the man is unscrupulous enough to blackmail to
obtain what he feels is truthfully his, but feel positive that he will
speak to anyone of influence to assist in obtaining back salaries that
he feels is his. Cite the five reasonably important personnel refer-
ences that he lists on his Job Application Form. We are not dealing
with the common type individual using vealied threats, but someone who
is an intelligent individual who at one time exerted enough influence
on Jack Anderson to appoint a Chief Pilot and further influence Gen.
Lewis Walsh into taking action to hire some of his buddys,

Mr. Whitehouse has had sinus trouble off and on
