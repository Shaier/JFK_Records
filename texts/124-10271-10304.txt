CIA has established a U.S. based notional organization
representing itself as being communist oriented and having the
following mailing addresses: P.O. Box 444, Boston, Massachusetts,
02102 and P.O. Box 8272, General Post Office, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, 19101. The organization's activity in the U.S.
will be restricted to production of propaganda in the form of
pamphlets, etc., which material will be mailed to various Left
Wing groups in foreign countries. The primary objective of
this operation is to develop penetrations and/or sources in
revolutionary Arab groups in the Middle East. The organization
is completely notional in character in that there will be n
offices in the U.S. (only p.o. boxes) and even the officials.
will bear fictitious names. CIA hopes that once the propaganda
begins circulating, Arab groups will become interested and will
endeavor to establish contact with "officials" of the organization
If this develops, CIA will then proceed to use its own personnel
under "suitable" cover to make the contact. From then on CIA
will maneuver to penetrate the target group. 75
In response to the Liaison Agent's request, CIA will
furnish us samples of propaganda. The Agent also asked that we
be given copies of communications sent to the mailing addresses
by any organizations or individuals. We should have such data
so that we can take the necessary investigative action in the
event any persons or organizations in the U.S. take an interest
in the captioned group. We, of course, will also be interested
in international ramifications which could have a bearing on...
the activities of Left Wing activity in this country. The Agent
also asked for the names of the officials which will be related
to the Union for Revolution. 7(S
At At this stage there does not appear to be any conditions
or developments which would have an adverse bearing on our
operations or jurisdiction providing that CIA keeps us adequately
informed. CIA asks that it be apprised of any information coming
to our attention concerning the organization. CIA further requests
that its interest not be revealed outside of the Bureau and that
this information be handled on a need-to-know basis
