with U. S. business representatives discreet, a small luncheon was held
in lieu of the customary formal briefings in the Headquarters building.
KUACETONE-1, IDENTITY 1, David C. HIGBY and Floyd N. AIMONET
attended the luncheon which was characterized by cordiality and candor.
KDACETONE-1 waited until the conclusion of the meeting to raise his
current favorite subject, that of countering the leftist propaganda

the latest cases with some alarm. KDACETONE-1 repeated his prediction
that President ECHEVERRIA would effectively nationalize most private
investment in Mexico before the end of his term.
3. The meeting was judged effective and afforded HIGBY the
opportunity to lay the ground work for his future relations with
IDENTITY 2 members, while satisfying the guests' need for reassurances
that our goals were parallel. They appeared happy with the conversations
despite the informality.
