2. Indonesia
a.
The new 21-man cabinet ap-
pears to be a coalition of Arab
nationalist elements including four
members of the moderate wing of the
Baath Party. The regime is still
dominated by the military, with eight
cabinet posts.
b. The new prime minister,
Tahir Yahya, is sympathetic to the
Baath Party, and both the Baathists
and the Egyptians feel they can
trust him.
c. The political affiliation
of eight of the new ministers is
not known, but the key interior post
is in the hands of an anti-Baathist
nationalist.
a. Defense Minister Nasution
has been ordered by Sukarno to make
conciliatory statements on Malaysia
while on his trip abroad.
b. The Dutch chargé who re-
ported this explained that Nasution
was chosen for this job because
Sukarno was irritated with the ultra-
tough line the defense minister has
taken.

c.
The chargé has no informa-
tion on the motives behind this
switch. Our embassy thinks it may
be a move to pave the way for explora-
tory talks by Foreign Minister Suband-
rio at Bangkok with his Thai and
Philippine counterparts. It may also
be meant to provide a more recep-
tive attitude for Nasution's visit
here.
d. Our embassy thinks Nasution
went in for his Malaysia sabre rat-
tling on Sukarno's orders, or at
the very least, with the president's
tacit support. Sukarno may feel
Nasution has stolen some of his
thunder.

Adoula still did not get
around to announcing the expulsion
of all Soviet and Czech embassy per-
sonnel yesterday. However, his
10 people managed on Tuesday afternoon
to corral and hog-tie the Soviet
counselor and press attaché before
they could eat-up all the incrimin-
ating papers in their possession.

b. The Russians are now being
held at Ndolo prison. The Congolese

(among other things, minutes of a

and a document showing Soviet pay-
ments to this group.

c.
The Belgian ambassador
thinks these papers are probably
genuine. He says the Russians have
made the mistake of underrating the
Congolese and have stumbled into a
surete trap.
d. The Congolese also picked
up two Czech diplomats but have since
released them. This morning they
arrested the correspondent of the
Soviet news agency.
a. Haile Selassie is planning
to withdraw all Ethiopian troops

b. The two battalions of
Ethiopians provide the guts of the
UN operation. They had been slated
to stay until June and are likely to
be very difficult to replace.
c. The Emperor reportedly.
ordered the withdrawal on grounds
that the troops are urgently needed
in Ethiopia, particularly in view
of the Soviet military accord with
Somalia.
d. Our ambassador has asked
to see the Emperor, as well as the
prime minister and foreign minister,
to press for reconsideration.

a.
Military activity has
slackened but the stalemate continues.
b. Egypt still has about 32,000
troops in Yemen, and Saudi Crown
Prince Faysal believes Nasir will
not withdraw any significant number
of them before 4 January when the
extension of the disengagement agree-
ment expires.
c. Faysal is preparing to re-
sume aid to the royalists at that
time; he is stockpiling quantities
of arms and ammunition along the
border.

a. The opposition Justice
Party, heir of the old Menderes re-
gime, appears to have won a victory
in Sunday's nationwide local elec-
tions on the basis of incomplete re-
turns.
b. The collapse of Prime Min-
ister Inonu's coalition government
appears increasingly likely. Though
a new coalition may be formed, there
will be considerable resistance to
the retention of Inonu as prime min-
ister.

be putting on pressure for early
national parliamentary elections.
However their party leaders do not
believe the Turkish military, which
ousted Menderes in 1960, would per-
mit them to take over if they won
new elections.

NOTES
A. Cuba The U-2 which flew yesterday's mission over
Cuba crashed while returning, about 40 miles north
of Key West. Air and sea rescue craft were sent to
the scene. An air rescue unit sighted an unopened
parachute, a life raft, and oil slick in the crash
area. The pilot is presumed lost. There is no in-
dication that the plane was attacked.
B. Berlin Local East German troops acting without
higher authority appear to have been responsible
for turning high powered searchlights on pilots tak-
ing off from West Berlin's Tempelhof airfield on
14-16 November. There were five such incidents. A
message of 16 November instructed border guard ele-
ments to discontinue such acts. There have been no
further incidents reported since.

D. Iran-USSR The Soviet Union's timing seems to be
off in Iran. Government sources have reported that
a twin engined plane was shot down in Iranian ter-
ritory restenday by Soviet jet fighters who violated
Iranian air space. The Iranians say that the plane
was on a photographic mission in connection with the

government's land reform drive. The pilot was injured
and his two passengers were killed. The incident
comes at a time when Soviet President Brezhnev is
visiting Tehran. He addressed a joint session of
parliament today.
E. Venezuela Police seem to have restored order in
に
downtown-Caracas, but terrorism contimes elsewhere.
The slum district of Caracas to which the terrorists
retreated is under virtual martial law. Among other
things, the Dupont paint warehouse at Maracaibo was
set afire_and_totally destroyed.
F. World Peace Council The WPC meeting in Warsaw next
Thursday may wind up in another free-for-all. The
Chinese Communist delegation, although not intent on
disrupting the conference, plans to attack the WPC
president's report given to a committee meeting in
Vienna last September. The Japanese delegates plan
to give general support to the Chinese and will try
to forestall a vote on the Moscow test ban treaty.

obviously hope to reach an under- -

e. An intercepted message in-

for perhaps 250 missiles will be
drawn up late in the period if all

c. Design requirements call
for the delivery of a 1,600-pound
warhead to a maximum range of 300
miles with a CEP slightly in excess
of half a mile. A conventional war-
head would not make military sense
under these specifications.
a. Pamphlets and posters
bitterly lampooning Nasir, espe-
cially for his involvement in Yemen
and Algeria, have appeared on the
streets of Cairo and Suez.
b. Such public expression of
anti-Nasir sentiment is highly
unusual.
c. It is still in a very low
key, however, and there is no sign
of organized opposition.
d. We do not consider Nasir
to be in any immediate danger of
overthrow, though he could be forced
to modify unpopular policies if the
discontent spreads.

which Embassy La Paz attributes to

c. Lechin, who has ambitions
to replace President Paz, intends
to tour the country to rally his
political forces, now in disarray
as a result of some astute moves
by Paz.
d. If Lechin decides after
these soundings to come out openly

next year to point up his strength.

all personnel of the Soviet and Czech embassies.

B. USSR A new series of extended range missile tests
seems to be upcoming. Three Soviet range instrumen-

impact area, 6,500 miles from Tyuratam. There has
so far been no announcement closing the area. (INTER-

They have been designed more for

their new responsibilities. There
are, however, a few signs of dissen-
sion within this group and between
it and civilian politicians.
g. One of the more ambitious
and troublesome figures is the able
but opportunistic General Ton That
Dinh, the new Minister of Security.
He has been travelling about the
country spreading ading the idea that the
coup was largely his doing and seems
bent on developing his own independ-
ent base of power. He is a man to
watch.

a. The death toll from the

c. The Betancourt government
has struck back hard. Its new uni-
fied command over the security forces,
set up at US urging, passed this
initial test with flying colors.
d. At least 500 extremists
were arrested and the round-up is
still going on. Their removal will
hamper the Communist drive against
elections in major cities like Caracas.
e. We now expect the elections
to be held on schedule, a consider-
able achievement under the circum-
stances. The elections will be fol-
lowed, however, by a Communist ef-
fort to prevent the March inaugura-
tion of the victor.
f. The rub here is that none
of the presidential candidates com-
mands President Betancourt's con-
siderable assets for dealing success-
fully with the harsh realities of
Venezuelan politics. The constitu-
tion prevents Betancourt from suc-
ceeding himself.
g. In the background, as
always, looms the military, which
could intervene if the president-
elect shows signs of being soft on
communism.

In the past week we inter-24
cepted Cuban military messages which 24
show that Cuban interpreters are now
posted at several surface-to-air mis-
sile (SAM) sites on the island.
b. We think this means that
on-site training of Cubans has begun
on schedule. Field training is to
last six months, after which the
SAN system may be turned over to
Castro.
c. In the past month some

d. Prior to their coming, we

e. We estimate that at least
15,000, and probably closer to
18,000, have been withdrawn in the
intervening 13 months, leaving, very
roughly, 4,000 to 7,000. Those re-

visors whose main functions are to
train and supervise Cubans in the
use of weapons turned over to them.

f. All Soviet weapons intro-

withdrawn or turned over to the

a. We have had an indication
that Soviet harassment of Allied ac-
cess routes to West Berlin will shift
this weekend to the air corridors.
b. The Soviet man at the Ber-
lin air traffic control center told
CIB bus the Allied representatives yesterday.
that Soviet transports would be using
the air corridors for brief flights
during the next five weekends.

c. Moscow has tried on a num-
ber of past occasions to assert its
right to restrict Allied use of the
air corridors. In early 1962, the
Soviets attempted to reserve "blocks"
of air space for their own use.
bave since demanded that Western
fligits stay between stipulated al-
titudes, that we file flight plans
in advance and provide prior notice
of border-crossing times.

d. This sort of harassment
stopped in the spring of 1962 when
Soviet leaders became convinced
that the US was interested in a
serious discussion of a Berlin settle-
ment. Moscow may hope that the
threat of more of this sort of har-
assment will jog the US into talks
on Berlin.
a. It now appears that Presi-
dent Arif's role in last Monday's
coup in Baghdad may have been vir-
tually that of a bystander.
b. According to our latest in-
formation, Arif was wakened early
that morning and given five minutes
to join up. Tahir Yahya, now prime
minister, was reportedly the orga-
nizer.
c. Whatever Arif's role may
have been, the coup was primarily
an effort by the Iraqi Army to cur-
tail the activities of the extreme
wing of the Baath Party. The Baath
is an Arab nationalist political or-
ganization, active throughout the
Arab world, which has been ruling
Iraq and Syria.

d. The coup group has not
thrown all Baathists out of the
government; there are party members
in the new cabinet.
e. Syrian Baathists have wel-
comed this retention of their Iraqi
brothers. Their attitude springs
C115 210 from the recognition that the Baath
in Syria cannot stay afloat without
support from Iraq. Even so, we hear
TDCS 3/565, 576 talk of coup plotting in Damascus.

f. The reaction of Nasir's
Egypt, which passionately desires
to see the Baath go under, has been
exactly the opposite. Cairo has been
backing off its all-out support for
the coup ever since the new cabinet
was announced.
