Interview:
Investigator Robert Buras spoke with Sgt. Roberts relative to
the attached report dated Aug. 12, 1963. Roberts stated that
he was in company with Sgt. Horace Austin who actually made the
report. The Officers spoke with all the arrested subjects in one
room at the same time. The only interest at that time was to
ascertain the possiblity of trouble from any individual or group
represented by the arrested subjects. Feelings were high in the
room and Roberts had to caution the Cubans to keep from trying to
argue with Oswald. At one point in the interview the Commanding
Officer of the First District, Captain James Arnold, came into the
room and asked Oswald if the Fair Play For Cuba Committee was
communist or a communist front. Oswald denied that he was a com-
munist and that the organization was a communist front. Oswald
stated that he joined the F.P.C.C. after finding a leaflet on the
street and sending $5.00 to New York. He also stated that he met
with members locally but did not want to give any names etc.
Roberts stated that he did not see or hear anything about
Oswald wanting to call or talk with an F.B.I. Agent while he was
there. Roberts couldn't remember any other details about the in-
terview.

:
Oswald further stated the Cubans came up to him where he was
giving out the leaflets and began to tear them up and throw them
in the street. Oswald stated that they started to yell that he
was a communist and about that time the officers from the First

which was in New York city and after a brief period of time he was

Oswald had in his possession and was carrying a piece of card-
board with"VIVA VIVA Fidel" painted on it and the paraphernalia
he was handing out was pasted on this cardboard also. Oswald
stated he has never been to Cuba, and it appeared as though he
is being used by these people and is very uninformed and knows
very little about this organization that he belongs to and
its ultimate purpose or goal. Oswald stated that the people that
attend these informal meetings are working class people, such as
clerical, trades, etc..
