1. (Field Comment: The following report should be read
in conjunction with TDCS-314/01096-68, HRS-4065 and
CS-311/02024-68, HRS-4099, which reported that Fernando
Melo Fontanills, a Cuban exile in Costa Rica, was serving as
an intermediary in negotiations between Ludwig Starke Jimenez,
a Costa Rican right-wing extremist, and Rolando Masferrer, a
Cuban exile in the United States who was involved in plotting
against the government of President Francois Duvalier of Haiti.
The negotiations dealt with a plan whereby Starke would pro-
vide a staging area for an invasion of Haiti by Haitian and
Cuban exiles under Masferrer's leadership. In return Mas-
ferrer, if successful, would subsequently support a move by
Starke against the Costa Rican Government. Kelo was reported
to be planning a trip to New York on 21 February 1968 to talk
with Masferrer and the latter's representative in the negotia-
tions, Father Diego Madrigal Alvarez.)
5,
2. When Melo returned to San Jose on 2 March after
visiting New York City and Miami, Florida, he was detained
and searched by security officials at the airport. Among
Melo's possessions the security officials found a letter
signed by Melo, addressed to Father Diego Madrigal, New York.
The letter was dated 9 February 1968, It sas typewritten on
letterhead stationery of Rogelio R. Pisto Impresos. (Costa
Rican Service Comment: Kelo sells printing equipment and
thus may have a business connection with the Pinto firm.)

3. Melo's letter acknowledged receipt of a cable from
Madrigal; it then went on to state that "Rogelio obtained
the visa" and now "the Haitian can come when he wishes."
(Field Comment: Rogelio zay be Rogelio Pinto. CS-311/02024-68
quoted Melo as saying that Starke had obtained a visa for
Jacques Moringlane, a Haitian who would be the first of
the Masferrer group to arrive in Costa Rica.) Kelo ther wote
that because nothing had been heard from Kadrigal since the
latter's visit to Costa Rica "the friends here" had begun to
believe that "everything has been a pipe dream of mine; that
ve neither are going to do anything nor have anything." Melo
complained that Madrigal's silence appeared to have "lessened smal
the enthusiasm of this man of action and of rapid resolutions,
who does not like to be made to waste his time." Kelo warned
Madrigal that if the Masferrer group had not reached a deci
sion to move ahead with the plan, it would be better for the
Haitian not to come to Costa Rica. Melo also warned that if
there were no Cubans participating in Masferrer's project, he,
Melo, would not support it, since he was interested only in
the Cubans problems and not those of the Haitians. Melo in-
formed Madrigal that he expected to arrive in New York on 18
February; he suggested that they discuss the subject in detail
at that time.
4. On 4 March Melo again left San Jose for Xiani. He
told the Costa Rican security officials that he would be away
from Costa Rica for a month.

SOURCE A high-level member of the National Liberation Party (PLN) who
has access to and the confidence of top leaders of his party.
Bis strong identification with the PLN and the knowledge that
his reporting will reach U.S. official circles probably cause
him to present his reporting to the best advantage of the PIN.
He has submitted reliable information during the past year, but
he has been known to withhold pertinent information. He received
the information from Daniel Oduber.
•
:
1. (Field Comment: TDCS-314/01096-68 reported that
Ludwig Starke Jimenez, a right-wing extremist who is the
leader of the security forces of the Movimiento Costa Rica
Libre (MCRL), anti-Communist businessmen's group, had in-
formed Daniel Üduber Quiros, of the National Liberation
Party (PLN), that he was making plans and seeking support
for a possible move against the Costa Rican Government in
the event that it should appear to be in danger of passing
into the hands of leftists. To that end Starke vas nego-
tiating with sympathetic groups outside of Costa Rica. Ho
eas in indirect contact with Rolando Masferrer, a Cuban
exile involved in plotting against the Governments of Haiti
and Cuba, through Fernando Hele Fontanilis, & Cuban exile
in Costa Rica who was in touch with a priest associated
with Masferrer.)
2. In mid-February Oduber said that he had contacted
Melo, whom he had known for some time, in an effort to learn
more about the negotiations between Starke and Masferrer, in
which Melo had been acting as an intermediary. Melo said
that the objective of the negotiations was to work out a
plan whereby Haitian and Cuban exiles, with Starke's

successful, asferrer and his Haitian cocerts would then
supply funds and armament to Starke for his projected move
against the Trejos government.
:
3. Helo later inforped Oduber that he was planning to
go to Sew York City on 21 February, ostensibly to visit nem-
bers of his family. However, ver, the true purpose of his visit
is to talk with Masferrer and Father Diego Kamuel Abilio
mal8
Madrigal Alvarez, the priest who has represented Masferrer-4269
in the negotiations, through Melo, with Starke. Kelo
been commissioned by Starke to ascertain the quantity and
source of arms that the Hasferrer group will make available
to Starke if the group succeeds in overthrowing Duvalier.
Melo also is to find out what other assistance the Masferrer
group sill provide to Starke, how many Haitian and Cuban
exiles Masferrer vill send to Costa Rica, and when they will
arrive.
4. Nolo said that a Costa Rican visa already has been
obtained for Jacques Moringlane, a Haitian, who will be the
first of the group of Haitian and Cuban exiles to come to
Costa Rica to set up their staging area. Koringlane's visa
es obtained by Starke through Rodrigo Arauz Bonilla, who
until recently was the chief clerk (oficial Rayor of the
Ministry of Public Security.
6. (Field Comments Melo has the reputation locally of
being an inveterate intriguer and a braggart. Therefore, his
veracity is open to question. It is possible that the infor-
sation he has given to Oduber is to some extent exaggerated
or distorted. It is also possible that Starke will find Helo
to be a less than trustworthy intermediary.)

1. TRIAL TURNED OUT TO BE BO PROBLEM FOR AGENCY
OR STATION, DEFENSE PLAN TO TURN IT INTO ANTI-CIA CIRCUS
"WAS TOTALLY FRUSTRATED BY JUDGE CABOT'S FIRM RULING. AND
BUSINESS-LIKE APPROACH OF U.S. ATTORNEY MEADOWS. ANSVIRL-1
WAS NEVER CALLED AS WITNESS, SOR VERE ANY OF OTHER
FORMER AGENCY ASSOCIATES OR EMPLOYEES VHOM DEFENSE. HAD
ASKED TO HAVE SUBPOENAED. ONE PROSECUTION WITNESS ABOUT WHOM
WE HAD BEEN VORRIED, DAVID CABEZA, FORMER AGENT AND RECENTLYte
PERSISTENT HARASSER OF CIA AND JAVE, HANDLED HIMSELF
EXTREMELY VELL. COURT RULINGS PREVENTED DEFENSE FROM

THE LATTER WAS MOST SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTION AS IT RELATED
DIRECTLY TO QUESTIONS INVOLVING CIA. U.S. ATTORNEY PUT FORTH
MOTION, WHICH COURT GRANTED, WHICH REQUIRED THAT QUESTIONS
TO WITNESSES ON CROSS-EXAMINATION WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO MENTION
OF CIA BE ASKED AFTER JURY HAD LEFT COURTROOM.
3. LOCAL PRESS COVERAGE WAS LIGHT AND FACTUAL. PRESS
SHOVED SO DESIRE TO EXPAND UPON OR INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS
OF CIA CONNECTION. AS FAR AS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE,
THERE WAS NO NATIONAL PRESS COVERAGE OF TRIAL. INTEREST IN
TRIAL IN LOCAL CUBAN AND HAITIAN COMMUNITIES MINIMAL.
:
4. TRIAL REPRESENTS SETBACK FOR ROBERT K. BROWN. ONE
OF HIS LOCAL HENCHMEN, MARTIN CASEY, WAS CONVICTED. ANOTHER
OF HIS LOCAL HENCHMEN, RALPH EDENS, WAS PRESENT AS OBSERVER
DURING ENTIRE TRIAL AND WAS OVERHEARD BY FERENCE, MAKING ANTI-
CIA REMARKS AND ALLEGATIONS IN CONSULTATION WITH
