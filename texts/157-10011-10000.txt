OCCURRENCE:
The Special Group discussed (1) the possibility of providing sixty
thousand dollars from the Cuba budget to sponsor the religious activity of Father
Peyton in Cuba; (2) a proposal to survey the possibility of establishing a strike
base in Nicaragua; (3) the necessity for the Defense Department to supply 38 military
men to CIA. "Mr. Douglas questioned whether the present concept of 600 or 700
Cubans is any longer practicable. He said that it had been his understanding that
-the-current-thinking-contemplated_figures_more_on_the_order_of_3,000." Mr. Barnes
replied that the CIA believes what is required is enough individuals to serve as
a rallying point for the anti-Castro elements in Cuba and thus 600 is as useful as
3,000. The CIA justified the request for 38 military men because it now believed
it was necessary to train the Cubans in infantry tactics involved in a defense, in
addition to the guerrilla warfare training previously contemplated.

Lansdale briefed the group on numbers of agents in Cuba. Air resupply
proposal submitted by CIA "should be deferred pending broader review of the entire
situation." Taylor noted if urgent need for air supply proposal could be made to the
Special Group Augmented at any time. "Mr. McCone emphasized that no high-level penetra-
tions of the Cuban government have yet been attained." "The Attorney General inquired
about the status of popular support for Castro, and also the possibility of a revolt
_against_him." Lansdale_replied, "There is no rallying point for active opposition."
The AG and Johnson emphasize need to obtain hard intelligence on subversive activities
by Castro in the hemisphere. A complete review of MONGOOSE was set toward the end of
July. Taylor emphasized need for summaries of results "and a statement of future al-
ternatives open to the U.S. should be developed." Looking into proposal to subsidize
Japanese purchases of Dominican sugars so that the Japanese could divert these purchases
from Cuba. McCone said that his experts had informed him that from a legal point of view,
CIA could use unvouchered funds to support an operation of this kind. He cautioned,

OCCURRENCE: Efforts were made to establish contact with Juana Castro Rug, half sister
of Fidel and Raul Castro Ruz, because she opposed the strong Communist nature of the
Cuban regime. According to Mrs. Virginia Leitao ao de Cunha, she contacted Ruz and obtained
Ruz agreement to provide intelligence on the Cuban political leadership and to work
against the Cuban Communist regime, "short of engaging in activity which might result in
direct personal charm to her brothers Raul and Fidel. Arrangements were being made for
direct recruitment of Ruz in Mexico.

OCCURRENCE: Lansdale traces the history of the project from its inception on Nov. 30,
1961 through March 1, 1962. Under the latter date, he notes, "The Chief of Operations
/Lansdale/is to report to the President through the Special Group (NSC 5412 Augmented
by the Attorney General and the Chairman, JCS); the Special Group will be responsible for
providing policy guidance for approving important operations, and for monitoring progress."
(00181) Lansdale also submitted an intelligence plan for basic intelligence collection
upon which to base the decision to undertake actions to cause the overthrow of Castro.
The plan itself-at-pages-00183-through-00187, included establishing intelligence-agents-
inside Cuba; collecting intelligence from Cubans inside the United States; counterfeiting
ration cards and currency inside of Cuba; geographical surveys of air fields, military
installations, communications centers; attempts to place trained agents inside the government
organizations or to defect officials "in place"; and gotiating for British help in
contaminating lubricants and fuels to cripple Cuban transportation. "The British want to
know, how serious are your before misking their assets to help the us.. (00180-00187)

The memo
OCCURRENCE: Memo for Richard Helms from Gen. Lansdale concerning NSA cover.
alludes to a conversation on the previous day, Jan. 31, 1962, about (NSA cover for the
Cuba Project. It indicates that Cuba cover is top priority. It indicated that this was not
possibly known to the members of the United States Intelligence Board. The problem seemed to
be to be able to decide how much of NSA (National Security Agency)'s assets were needed to
provide cover for the Cuban project.

OCCURRENCE: llelms testified that the aim of the Cuban operations was "to
get rid of Castro or the Castro regime in Cuba, lets put it that way, and no
limitations were placed on the means. In fact, I never recall having been told by
anybody do not do this, do not do that, do not do the other thing." (26) (The
above statements refer to Mongoose.) Helms testified that "the pressure was very
intense and I remember vividly it was very intense." The pressure led to several
"very nutty schemes." (26) Helms testified the pressure built up to the Bay of Piga
and then lay dormant for awhile and intensified again toward the end of 1961 and
1962. The Cuban Hissile Crisis itself was the period of greatest intensity.
wards interest tapered off, although Helms recalled efforts in 1963 involving
"economic warfare" such as turning off oil deliveries and stopping bus deliveries
Including an attempt to stop the sale by thelreyland Bus Company in Spain of busosat
