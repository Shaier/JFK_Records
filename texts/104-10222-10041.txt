MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
SUBJECT : Compromise of Cover
1. As a result of information obtained from reliable
sources who served in Vietnam, we have established that
the former Staff personnel listed on the attachment should
be presumed to have been compromised as CIA employees to
the North Vietnam Intelligence Service as of April 1975.
We presume also that the identifications of these individ-
uals as CIA employees were passed by the North Vietnamese
to the Soviets.
2. Although the personnel listed in the attachment
are no longer employed by CIA, nevertheless, I suggest
that their official personnel records should be documented
concerning the possible past compromise of their cover.
3. Please coordinate any action connected with this
memorandum with Chief, CCS; Chief, CMGB and Chief, CI
Staff.

Conein was in U.S. military from September 1941 through
September 1961, and on detail to OSS, SSU, CIG, and CIA to time
of military retirement.
He was picked up as a civilian and as a career agent on
12 November 1961 and retired on dizability on 15 July 1968.
Archenhold advised that subject claims military service as
indicated above and that the only period to be certified is the period
as a civilian, November '61 to July ¿z. This all we know about
what Concin told DEA.

Luke Conein has applied for employment
with the Drug Enforcement Agency. The
Acting D/Pers asked for the attached info
from CIA.
Sent to D/Pers for signature. Conein
was very controversial, much in the news
about the overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem and
has been mentioned by Howard Hunt in Hunt's
recent hearing before "Watergate" committee.
Dick Biladeau, Central Cover, affirms that
Conein is "opened up".

28 September 1973
Stan Archenhold, x 7264, one of the Agency's drug coordinators
with DEA, called me yesterday afternoon. DEA had requested a memo
verifying employment of Mr. Lucien E. Conein, whose name has
appeared frequently during the Watergate hearings. The attached
memorandum is what Archenhold wants.
Conein's service was verified with ROB; his 'honorable service"
was cleared with SAS. Since he was under cover as contract, I dis-
cussed the case with Dick Biladeau of Central Cover. CCS had
opened up Conein last year and Biladean approved release of the
information to DEA. We had verified this service to a Justice Depart-
ment investigator approximately one year ago when Conein was being
considered as a consultant for BNDD.
Archenhold offered to carry the memorandum to DEA.
