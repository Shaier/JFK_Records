Mr. Halley, is it true that you are here

testifying today under alias, and that Halley is not actually
your true identity?
Mr. Halley. That is correct.
6
Mr. Baron. Your true identity will be on file with the
7
review staff of the CIA and available for verification by the
8
Committee if that becomes necessary?
9
10
Mr. Halley. That is my understanding.
Mr. Baron.
Let me show you a piece of paper marked
11 "Statement Regarding Testimony and Alias" and let me ask you
12
whether this is the statement you signed as we were beginning
14
15
16
13
here today which indicates your true identity and which I have
witnessed?
Mr. Halley. Yes, that is the correct statement that I
signed today. There is a blank there where we have not filled
17
in the Senator's name.
18

Mr. Baron. All right.
For the moment, let us leave that blank and enter it into

Mr. Baron. Are you appearing here, voluntarily here today
without counsel?
Mr. Halley. Yes, I am.
Mr. Baron. Are you also aware that at any point you are
entitled to cease answering any questions and consult with
counsel if you wish?
Mr. Halley. Yes, I am aware of that.
Mr. Baron. Finally, are you aware that all your Constitu-

to this conversation going on the record.

Mr. Baron. Thank you.

Let us begin then with some very broad questions
:
11
12
13
about your background in the Agency. Can you tell me what you
were doing in the Agency prior to your involvement with the
JMWAVE station?

Mr. Halley. I became involved with the Cuban affair in
approximately February of 1962. At that time, I was in Head-
quarters. I was Chief of Foreign Intelligence Activities for the
Eastern European Division. I was asked to be released from those
duties to conduct a survey of the opportunities for running
intelligence operations against Cuba. I was released from those
duties; I did engage in a survey of the possibilities for running
intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary operations
21
22
against Cuba.
23
24
Mr. Baron. Your position as Chief of Foreign Intelligence
for Eastern Europe did not involve Cuba in any way? That was
25
your last position before you became involved in Cuban affairs,

is that correct?
2
Mr. Halley. That is correct.
3
I want to qualify that.
Undoubtedly, there were some
4
5
6
7
actions that were being conducted in the Eastern European area
that reflected on Cuba, but I was not involved in the Bay of Pigs
operation. I was not fully focused on Cuban operations until
approximately February of 1962.

Mr. Baron. At what point did you join the Agency?
Mr. Halley.
I joined the Agency originally in 1951.
Mr. Baron. In a very general way, can you describe the
nature of your activities at the Agency prior to February of '62
Mr. Halley. When I was first assigned to the Agency, I was
an Army officer on active duty. I went through the usual Agency
training program. I was assigned to Eastern European activities
where I originally was focused on Polish and German operations.
15
16
17
I subsequently served from 1952 to 1959 in Germany. In the
course of that service, I spent most of my time working on the
18
19
20
Eastern European satellites, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Romania, Bulgaria. In addition, I was involved on occasion in
Soviet operations and East German operations.
21
22
23
Mr. Baron. Did you have any involvement in Latin American
affairs prior to February of '62?
Mr. Halley. Yes. In the period 1960-62, I was responsible
24
for setting up operational activity in Latin America that
25
was targetted more explicitly on the Eastern European satellites
TOP SECRET

to some extent on the Soviet Union. This was in a period of time
where the Eastern European satellites were expanding their
3 presence in Latin America. In my duties in the Eastern European
:
5
Division, I was responsible for getting this program going in
Latin America, so I did have an extensive exposure to Latin
6
7
America: in the period '60 to '62, as I recall those dates.
The accuracy of those dates can be checked from my official
travel records, and so on.

16
Mr. Halley. No, I was stationed in Washington, but I
travelled to Latin America during this particular period of
time.
Mr. Baron. Did you travel to Cuba at any point during the
course of that operation?
Mr. Halley. Not specifically. I think I transitted Cuba
17
on air stops being routed to various countries.
I think I was
18
at one or two Cuban airfields, but simply in transit.
Mr. Baron.

Not long enough even to talk to the people at
the Station in Cuba?
20
Mr. Halley.
21
No, I had no contact at any time with the
Havana Station.
22
23
Mr. Baron. Did you pick up, during this period of time,
24
a general sense of the attitude of Latin American governments
25
toward the Castro government? Could you characterize that

Mr. Halley. I certainly was aware, I think, of the broad
political trend in the Hemisphere at that time, my interest was
much more narrowly focused at that time on the Eastern European
targets, and on the Soviet target, and I was not certainly
specializing in Cuban affairs at that juncture.
Mr. Baron. Cuba was not viewed at that juncture as part of
the Soviet target, as a Soviet satellite?
Mr. Halley. No, it was not.
Mr. Baron. Coming then to February of '62, is that the
point at which you joined the JMWAVE Station in Miami?
Mr. Halley. No. When I first entered into this survey,
it was to do this on a TDY basis, temporary duty assignment,
to complete a report on my findings, to report those at that
particular juncture to Mr. Harvey who was the head of the Task
Force that was attempting to expand intelligence coverage of
Cuba and I was not assigned to the station at that particular
point in time.
Mr. Baron.
At what point did you join the JMWAVE Station?
Mr. Halley. Shortly after having completed this survey.
These dates are blurred now because the survey soon turned into
a permanent assignment. I would have to check the exact dates
from my service records, but after having completed the survey
report, shortly thereafter I was asked to go to Miami to become
permanently assigned to the station in Miami. I do not recall

the exact date at which that permanent change of station took

Mr. Baron.
4
the end of May of '62?
Would you assume that that was sometime before
5
Mr. Halley. Yes. It was probably before that, but as I
6
say, there are a couple of weeks gap that we would have to look
7
at my service record to get the exact dates, but certainly it
8
could have been March, it could have been April: But I reserve,
9
you know, the right to check my record if that is a critical
10 point in terms of what you are trying to establish.
11
Mr. Baron.
Certainly.
12
13
I should say generally at this point, if anything we cover
today gives you that kind of problem it would be immensely
14
15
helpful to us if you would check your answers against documents
that might be available in the CIA.
16
Mr. Halley. Yes, all right.
17
Mr. Baron. In fact, let me ask you if you would check that
18
19
one out, because it would be useful to know exactly when you
joined the JMWAVE station.
20
21
22
During the period of time before you joined JMWAVE, while
you were conducting the survey, did you report to anyone other
than William Harvey?
23
24
Mr. Halley. In a formal sense, this TDY was conducted on
behalf of the task force commander, who was Mr. Harvey. While
25
I was in Miami conducting the survey, I obviously discussed

matters pertaining to that survey to the team who was then in
2 charge of the operational activity in Miami.
That team was
3
essentially headed by Mr. Al Cox, who has since died.
4
Mr. Baron. Was that team the equivalent of JMWAVE station?
5
6
7
Mr. Halley. Yes. Mr. Cox was the head, then, of what would
be the equivalent of the JMWAVE Station.
Mr. Baron. Was he the head of JMWAVE until the wint when
8
you replaced him, or until the point you became Chief of the
9 JMWAVE Station?
10
Mr. Halley. That is correct. He was the head of that
11 unit until such time as I replaced him.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware during this survey that you
were conducting of any link between Task Force Wand the so-called
Special Group in the White House which was part of the National
Security Council structure and used the project namer! MONGOOSE
for anti-Cuban operations?
Mr. Halley. My understanding at the time that I conducted
this survey was that there was a three-man group in existence
which was headed by Mr. Robert Kennedy that was conducting a
20 survey to see what kind of activities could be conducted against
21
Cuba.
22
The other members of that particular group were General
Lansdale and Mr. Helms.
This three-man group had subordinate to it for all practical
23
24
purposes the task force unit which was managed by Mr. Harvey.
25
I am not familiar, however, with the other terminology that you
TOP SECRET

Mr Baron.During the whole period of your involvement
with JMWAVE, you were not made aware of Project MONGOOSE as
such?
Mr. Halley. I am not aware of Project MONGOOSE. I do not
recall it as an acronym, cryptonym or anything else that was in
common usage in my conversations.
Also, you have to understand that during that particular
time, Mr. Harvey was subordinate to the normal Agency chain of
12 command. In other words, he had parallel lines, if you wil1.
13 There was this three-man Task Force to whom he was reporting
14
15

17

20

22

regularly. At the same time, as the Task Force Commander, he
was reporting to the then-DDP who was Mr. Helms.
Mr Baron. You began your survey just about the time that
Mr. Helms replaced Mr. Bissell as DDP?
Mr. Halley. That is right.
Mr. Baron. Were you aware of the command relationship
between the three-man group that you have mentioned and William
Harvey as head of Task Force W? Did that group task Harvey
directly, or did Harvey's assignments have to come through Helms
and through the DCI as opposed to this group that did not include
the DCI?
Mr. Halley. My understanding of it at the time was we were
TOP SECRET
1 0 0 0 2009 2
WARD & PAUL
C
Phone (Area 202) 544-6000
TOP SECRET
1 really talking about parallel lines. In other words, this
2 three-man group was meeting. Mr. Helms was both a member of
11
3
that particular group and the DDP. Therefore, when he came back
8
9
10
11
12
13
4
5

7
from one of these meetings and issued instructions to Mr. Harvey
it was, you know, tantamount to these things coming through two
channels simultaneously, one coming from this three-man task
force and the other instruction simultaneously coming from Mr.
Helms who was the DDP.
Mr. Baron. As far as Mr. Harvey was concerned, an assign-
ment or order from Richard Helms was an order to be taken at
face value? Harvey did not have to question whether it had the
stamp of approval from the DCI or not? Would that have been
your operating understanding?
14
15
Mr. Halley. That would have been my understanding, yes.
Certainly an instruction received from Mr. Helms was a valid
16
Agency instruction.
17
Mr. Baron.
The DCI at this point was John McCone.
18
Mr. Hallay. That is correct.
Mr. Baron.
19
Do you have any knowledge of the relationship
20
between this three-man group and John McCone at that point?
21
Mr. Halley.
Not on a day to day basis. Once I went to
22
Miami, I came back on a regular basis to review operational
23
plans and programs. On one occasion I accompanied Mr. McCone
24
25
to the White House to give a presentation or sit in while the
presentation was being made.

6

10
Mr. Baron. Was that a Cabinet meeting or was it a Special
Group meeting as a sub-unit of the National Security Council?
Mr. Halley. You know, that happened in 1962. This is
1975. I do not recall then with precision as to whether it was
a meeting of the Cabinet or whether it was a meeting of the
11 National Security Council, or whether it was a meeting of the
12
Special Group.
13
Mr. Baron. That: is perfectly understandable.
14 which Cabinet members were present at that meeting?
Do you recall
15
Mr. Halley. Yes. My recollection of that was that Mr.
16 McNamara was present, Mr. Rusk was present, Mr. Kennedy, the
17 Attorney General, was present. You know, I am just vague now
18
at this particular point.
Those are the ones that stick out in
19
my memory as being present.
20
Mr. Baron. Was the DCI present?
21
Mr. Halley. Yes, the DCI was present, and he gave a
portion of the presentation.
22
As I recall, Mr. FitzGerald gave

the other portion of the presentation.

they had in which the President was present?

were being conducted against Cuba.
Mr. Baron. Was there any mention of any assassination
effort at that meeting?
Mr. Halley. No, there was not.
Mr. Baron. You were attending at that point in connection
with the survey you conducted?
Mr. Halley. No. I was attending at that point as the
Station Chief from Miami in order to make a contribution to the
issues that were being discussed, to the fact that detailed,
substantive back-up for whatever questions might be put to the
Agency spokesmen. I made reference to that because you asked
me if I knew the relationship between Mr. McCone and this
three-man group. I said no, on a day-to-day basis I did not
know the relationship, but that there were meetings that were

Mr. Baron. Were you aware that that group might have gone
by any particular name or designation?

No, I am not.,

Mr. Baron.
You are not familiar with the term Special
8
Group?
9

11
12
13
Mr. Halley. Yes, I am aware of the term Special Group.
I am aware that the chronology of the 303 Committee, Special
Group, 40. Committee and so forth, but as I mentioned to you
earlier, that particular time, I cannot distinguish between
whether this was an ad hoc meeting or this was a Special Group
meeting, or what it was.
Mr. Baron. Did you assume at that time that the three-man
14
15
group that you referred to, including the Attorney General,
20
21
16
17 General Lansdale and Richard Helms, had a formal relationship
18
19
to this larger Special Group? In other words, was that three-
man group a kind of decision-making sub-unit of the Special
Group, or do you think it operated entirely independent from
the National Security Council structure.
22
23
Mr. Halley. I do not think I can give you an authoritative
answer to that. I would go back to what I previously told
24
you.
25
When I entered into this project in February of '62, the
chain of command that. I was familiar with was this three-man

2
of command, paralleling that, was Mr. Harvey reporting to the
3 DDP and the DDP subsequently reporting through his chain of
4
5
command to the Director, and that would be the only way that
I could characterize that with any accuracy.
Mr. Baron. Did those two chains of command continue
as the channels of decision-making and tasking when you were
or during your tenure as Chief of Station at JMWAVE?
Mr. Halley. That relationship changed, and again I do
not have the date at my fingertips at what time that changed.
I know that shortly thereafter I was in Miami, General
Lansdale came down to visit me, to talk with me, about the
progress that was being made in the operational program. At
some point after that, this three-man group for all intents
and purposes disappeared. General Lansdale was reassigned;
the group broke up; subsequent reviews of the program were made
at the Special Group level. As an example, we would have to
submit every month the number of operations that we were going
to run, such as infiltrations into Cuba through what would be
paramilitary means, and these were approved by the Special
Group.
There was an approval procedure for setting those up,
so subsequently the three-man group disappeared and the regular
mechanism of the Special Group came into play.
I am sorry, I cannot give you a precise date for that
change, but I am sure it is in the record and I am sure you even

Mr. Halley. Why do you not define for me what you consider

Mr. Baron. Perhaps we can turn it around and say, could
you characterize the kinds of operations generally that you

Mr. Halley. Initially, the three-man group was seized
with the problem of conducting the survey of what could be
done against Cuba. As soon as that was more or less agreed
upon, my understanding of this, as I told you, the three-man
group was disbanded or atrophied or went on to other things
and then the formal mechanism came in for approval, that is,

the Special Group. As procedures. became more formalized, we

In other words, if we were going to run an operation that
was going to be a cache replacement in the Cuban mainland, that
had to be put in, say in our October schedule, that October
schedule had to be submitted to the Washington Headquarters so
they could make it available to the Special Group sometime in
September. So I would regard a cache, say the lowest kind of
8 operation in terms of sensitivity, and then you could move up

Mr. Baron. If there had been any operation with the
assassination of Fidel Castro, or other high Cuban government
14 leaders as its objective, would such an operation have been
referred to either the three-man group or later the Special
16 Group.

Mr. Halley. If such an operation had been proposed from
Miami, it would have had to have gone through that particular
process.
Mr. Baron. Your answer seems to indicate that only
operations that originated at the JMWAVE Station would be
referred up for approval.
Is that correct?
Mr. Halley. That is the kind of activity that I have
firsthand knowledge of. When I became the Station Chief, I told
