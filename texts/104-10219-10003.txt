DCS Case 52872
Santa Monica, Calif. 90401
1. Interviewed 23 Apr 69, Huch C. McDonald, a cleared DCS source,
informed that there appeared to be a misunderstanding in connection with
his visiting Washington. First, he does not plan on going to Washington
himself; a representative from the Chicago Office is going for the purpose
of meeting with the Financial Group Company. Next, McDonald said he has
not offered to demonstrate his Voice Ident System. Finally, he does not
plan a "world tour". Rather, sometime this Fall he plans on visiting
bankers and government security people in various Latin American countries.
He will return to the US; then, later on, visit various European countries.
Again he will return to the US and then visit various Far Eastern countries.
His purpose in making these trips is to sell Hughes helicopters to foreign
police departments combined with possible sale of his check cashing security
system to banking institutions.
2. McDonald will inform DCS/LAFO of his travel plans when they are
firmed up.
*3. McDonald is willing to go to Washington, D.C. himself on 8-9
May and meet with TSD/ORD people there to "discuss" his Voice Ident
System, but he is not prepared to do so unless TSD/ORD have some
specific problems which his system will help solve. He feels otherwise
it would be a waste of time.
4. The above discussed with DCS/OSS (Musulin) 29 Apr 69. It was
decided that since ORD (Carrick) has been in contact with McDonald
previously that Carrick discuss the possible meeting on the Voice
Ident System directly with McDonald.
5. McDonald was informed 29 April to expect a call from Carrick;
that DCS/LAFO would follow up later concerning his travels abroad.

Case 52722
1. John Purfey passed the attached to me on Saturday, 9 Hay.
FYI I would like to comment as follows.
2. (Item 1) It was Herbert White, not Beske, who reported reporte
on the new radical group at Pitzer, source Linda Knolles. We doubt
that we can obtain much more in response to CI/SO questions. We
will try, but with caution, since we are dealing with a young, obvious
liberal female. As for Tom Clark, we think he is back at Cornell.
Our report to you covered all we know to date.
3. (Item 2) R. D. Beske will try and determine what he can
about Dr. and Mrs. Leo Kiper at UCLA. If everything appears favoracle
and we can clear we may contact. However, they are unknown to us.
Aak CI/S0 what they can tell us about them. It will help.
4. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6) These people unknown to us. stho are
they? Where did Furfey get their names? What does he know about
them? that does he want us to do about them?
5.. (zem 7) As I have reported, I will not personally contact
John Cole. The FBI regards him as unsuitable to help them and,
based upon their assessment, I will not serve any requirements on
him. (Sorry my memo on this had an incomplete sentence.)
6. (Item 8) Answer is "no".
7. (Item 9)
I have contacted Reid and reported.
8. (Item, 10) Joseph Charles' PHS sent in 14 May.
9. (Item 11) I have told Purfey that Hugh McDonald is an
opinionated, egotistical ass who refuses to provide any data to support
his statements, thereby making it impossible to assess the information
he supplies.
10. (Item 12) Beske says the chance of Baum providing anything
is questionable.

11. (Item 13; I have finally figured out Purfey's West Pointer.
During one of our initial conversations I facetiously remarked, in
response to types he was looking for, that what he wanted was a red,
white and blue Negro, a graduate of West Point, who is now in the
export-import business dealing with Africa.
12. (Item 14) I told Furfey on Saturday that the local os
people are and have been in contact with the LAPD and the Sheriff's
Office on militant matters, that the OS people are known as Agency:
that 00 is reporting whatever they learn and for us to involve our-
selves would be corfusing and duplicative. If Furfey wants to know
what OS is getting, tell him to contact Ralph True in Headquarters/OS.
Purfey might want to consider having his requirements levied on OS.
13. (Item 15) Beske reports nothing new, and not likely to be
anything soon on the Connover-Clarke affair. Connover has changed
jobs and is too busy to do much.
14. (Item 16)
but he doubts it.
Beske reports Gonzales may have something on V.B.
He will check.
15. (Item 17) I told Furfey that I do not want to get in-
volved in any activity that would put us in the position of being
accused of investigating militants. We are on thin ice as it is.
Therefore, Devanon will not be asked to follow up on "Compton"
contects and wa will depend on OS police contacts.

DCS Case 53199
1. On 4 September 1969, Chief, LAFO, met with Hugh C. McDonald, President
of World Associates Inc. A former law enforcement officer (Chief of Detectives,
Los Angeles County Sheriffs' Office, retired) he has an excellent reputation
among law enforcement agencies. He has cooperated with the Agency fully in
the past. He is a cleared source of LAFO/DCS.
2. Since his retirement McDonald has started World Associates Inc., a
company with two divisions, the Security Division and the Aircraft Division.
3. The Security Division provides, as its primary service, a bank
security system, designed to provide banking institutions with a means to
control and curtail losses from fraud and robbery.
4. The Aircraft Division was set up because of the exclusive contract
World Associates has with the Hughes Tool Company (Hugnes Aircraft) for the
sale of helicopters to law enforcement agencies, to operate a helicopter pilot
training school for municipal and other law enforcement agencies and to handle
the installation of helicopter patrol systems. This contract applies to all
countries except the US. McDonald said he expects to sell the Hughes Model
300 helicopter to foreign law enforcement agencies. None of these has been
sold abroad, with the exception of the Philippines. He will have to open up
offices in order to demonstrate, sell and arrange for servicing of the
helicopters. A helicopter pilot-salesman and a technical representative would
be needed at a beginning cost of about $18,000 per year. HcDonald said he
would have a good, plausible reason for setting up such an office in Hong Kong,
not only to sell and service police helicopters in the Crown Colony, but alsc
to use as a base for other Asian country activities. McDonald expects to
start exploring the foreign police potential for helicopters in the near
future, beginning with a trip to South America.
5. The possibility of using foreign offices to promote the activities of
the Security Division of the company also exists.
6. Currently, McDonald is in Hawaif and is exploring the possibility of
setting up a police intelligence school in Hawaii to train police officers
from Asian countries.
7. Attached are copies of data pertaining to prospectus, products,
services, etc..
8. In the event Cover Division has any interest in this matter, Chief,
LAFO, will be glad to discuss it further at Headquarters during week of
5-11 October 1969.
