1. IN RESPONSE REF A QUESTION, AVAILABILITY IS MAIN
FEATURE, BUT EASE IN ADMINISTRATION AND SECURITY ARE ALSO
FACTORS INFLUENCING OUR PROPOSAL TO COMBINE PHOTO OPERATION
WITH KDVAULT TECHNICAL OPERATION. APARTMENT UNDER EARLIER
CONSIDERATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL PROBABLY SOMETIME
IN MAY, AND WE DO NOT NOW HAVE ANY SUITABLE CANDIDATES TO
TAKE POSSESSION WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. COMBINING BOTH
OPERATIONS WILL REDUCE NUMBER ASSETS INVOLVED, COSTS, AGENT
MEET INGS AND PROJECT ADMIN. SECURITY WILL BE ENHANCED BECAUSE
TWO ACTIVE SITES IN SUCH CLOSE PROXIMITY CKPOLAR INSTALLATION
WOULD DOUBLE COVER PROBLEMS AND DOUBLE NUMBER OF CLANDESTINE
MEETINGS TO RETRIVE PRODUCT.
2. IN SUM, BOTH APARTMENTS IN QUESTION HAVE ESSENTIALLY
SAME DESIRABILITY FEATURES FOR KDVAULT OPERATION.

Α. ΗΜΜΑ-41,028, 17 September 1971 (Previous Report)
B. HMMW-18,773, 23 December 1971
OPERATIONS
1.
The KDFACTOR Project continued throughout the past six
months to support two visual and photographic surveillance points
(KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against the MHHARSH installation.
ADMINISTRATION
2. Oliver J. MANKUNAS continued to have responsibility for inside
administrative chores and agent handling throughout the period.
Bruce H. FERNALD, who previously handled the assets, is the alternate
case officer and would be available to take over agent meeting respon-
sibilities in the absence of MANKUNAS. Processing of the photo
product is accomplished inside the Station. Agent meetings have now
been cut to a minimum, and the processing of the product and delivery
to the consumer has been speeded up.
PERSONNEL
3. The project includes five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2
operates the KDLITERAL basehouse and has been employed in this capa-
city since 1957. KDFACTOR-5 operates the KDABSINTHE basehouse with
the assistance of his wife KDFACTOR-6 and his two sons, KDFACTOR-8
and -9. KDFACTOR-5 has also served BKTRUST in this capacity since
1957.
PRODUCTION
4. KDLITERAL: During this reporting period, KDLITERAL, through
KDFACTOR-2, continued to be the source of within-the-compound photo-
graphic coverage of PCS and TDY MHHARSHers. He produced 55 rolls of

film and provided weekly written reports based on his daily visual
observation of the target area.
5. KDABSINTHE: Operated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABSINTHE produced
100 rolls of film and continued to be the principal source for infor-
mation on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, with special atten-
tion given to visits of "WOCORK-type" persons and political exiles.
This segment of KDFACTOR also continued to be the main source of
information on MHHARSH license plates and automobiles.
:
6. KDLITERAL and XDABSINTHE both continue to provide detailed
"attendance sheets" on all MHHARSH personnel. Without this combined
coverage, it would be difficult to identify personnel assigned to
the MHHARSH..installation or to monitor their daily movements and
activities. In addition, the two surveillance points provide periodic
photo studies of the MHHARSH installation itself with emphasis on
coverage of any constructionchanges and any modification or additions
made to the communications antenna system. Both sites are also
available to service special support requests as required. During
the period, KDLITERAL performed a number of special photo surveys and
a three-week frequency sweep requested by WOACRE.
SECURITY REVIEW
The assets
7. There were no known problems of security relating to the
project. In response to Reference B. request, we have reviewed all
phases of the operation and believe that project security is sound.
The project assets have all been with us for many years and have
established themselves as respectable long-time residents of the
area. All five assets, four in one family and one in another, are
extremely security conscious and have all been SGSWIRLed.
derive a substantial portion of their livelihood from their EKTRUSTY
employment and would thus lose a great deal if security factors ever
necessitated a termination of their work for us. As an additional
safeguard, the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented
from each other, and there has never been any indication that either
segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's existence.
8. The only termination of a project asset in recent years was
KDFACTOR-1, who formerly processed the photo product from both
surveillance points. KDFACTOR-l was terminated amicably in March
1971. We still maintain periodic contact with him; and his brother,
KDADAGE-14, continues to be one of our more valued MHHARSH access
agents. KDFACTOR-1 is a reputable physician with a wide circle of
friends, and on a number of recent occasions he has been very helpful
when we have taxed his expertise in his field or requested background
information on people in the medical profession. Although KDFACTOR-1
processed the photo product, he was not knowledgeable of the exact
surveillance point locations. Delivery and pickup of the finished
product was always accomplished by an outside case officer.
9. Contact is maintained with only two of the five assets.
KDFACTOR-2 and -5, both of whom are responsible for the operation of
their respective basehouses. Both KDFACTOR-2 and 5 are met weekly
to obtain the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE product for timely processing
and analysis by the Station. Meetings with KDFACTOR-2 are car pick-
ups at periodically changed locations in the suburbs. Meetings with
KDFACTOR-5 consist of car meetings early in the morning along his
route of travel to his overt job. These meetings last only long
enough to pick up the product, provide new supplies, and pay salaries,
rents, utility bills, etc. Emergency contact plans are on file at
the Station and have been forwarded to Headquarters on both KOFACTOR-
2 and -5. KDFACTOR-6, -8, and -9 are members of KDFACTOR-5's imme-
diate family and could be contacted through him using his emergency
plan.
10. We have taken action recently to guard against the contin-
gency that one of the present sites might be blown, and alternate

means might be required to continue the KDFACTOR coverage... In
February 1972 an apartment became available in the same building
complex which houses the KDABSINTHE installation. Through the
cooperation of KDABBEY-1, we were able quictly to rent the apart-
ment and install elements of the KDCALVERT team as residents. This
location affords as good, if not better, vantage point for continu-
ing photo coverage in the event the present KDABSINTHE location
becomes untenable.
We are also exploring alternate locations for
KDLITERAL to solve the problem we face with this element of KDFACTOR
coverage (see below).
PROBLEMS
11. The only known problem connected with the project is a
product of mother nature which is threatening the effectiveness of
KDLITERAL coverage. Approximately two years ago MHHARSH personnel
planted eight small trees along the edge of the terrace leading to
the garden. These trees have flourished and now have grown to the
point where KDFACTOR-2, the KDLITERAL operator, estimates he only
has a year more of effective operational capability. We are studying
ways of solving this problem and will forward a separate dispatch
to Headquarters on the topic in the near future.
FINANCES
12. There have been no changes in anticipated project expenses
shown below for FY 1972 and FY 1973.

14. The support provided by the KDFACTOR Project to the Station
REDTOP Program is indispensable. We believe the project represents
a professional collection effort being run securely and successfully
against a sensitive target with a minimal expenditure of funds and
case officer time.
