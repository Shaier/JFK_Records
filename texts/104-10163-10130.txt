1. DUSKIRT-2 HAS ASKED IF WE COULD OBTAIN FOR HIM THE CURRENT
ADDRESS OF MANUEL ARTIME. D-2 WAS FRIEND AND COLLABORATOR OF
ARTIME FROM 1959 UNTIL THEY LOST CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER IN 1968.
WHEN D-2 FIRST CAME TO PERU HE CARRIED LETTER SIGNED BY ARTIME
IDENTIFYING HIM AS ARTIME PERSONAL REP IN PERU.
2. D-2 WANTS TO CONTACT ARTIME TO ASK HIS HELP IN TAINING
NICARAGUAN PASSPORT. HE CLAIMS ARTIME RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMOZA
IS SUCH THAT ARTIME COULD OBTAIN FOR D-2 NICARAGUAN PASSPORT AND
S
PERHAPS SOME TYPE OF HONORARY CONCUL DESIGNATION, D-2 WILL WRITE
LETTER TO ARTIME EXPLAINING HIS SITUATION AND WILL ASK STATION
TO POUCH LETTER TO MIAMI FOR MAILING THERE EITHER DIRECTLY TO
ARTIME OR TO D-2 SISTER FOR HER TO DELIVER PERSONALLY TO ARTIME.
3. AS ABOVE INDICATES, D-2 REMAINS PREOCCUPIED WITH FACT. HE
DOES NOT POSSESS VALID PASSPORT. HE HAS TRIED NUMEROUS SCHEMES
TO OBTAIN SAME WITHOUT SUCCESS. HE STRONGLY FEELS HE MUST HAVE
DOCUMENTATION TO LEAVE PERU IF NECESSARY. HE WORRIES ABOUT

POSSIBILITY OF ONE DAY BEING ARRESTED, PERHAPS AS RESULT HIS
BKHERALD ACTIVITY. AND DEPORTED TO CUBA BY LEFTIST PERUVIAN
GOVT. HE ADMITS THAT HIS EXPERIENCES IN CUBA AFTER CASTRO'S
TAKEOVER COLOR HIS PERCEPTION OF THE DANGER IN HIS CURRENT
SITUATION BUT HE IS NOT WILLING TO REMAIN VULNERABLE TO SIMILAR
DEVELOPMENT IN PERU. EVENTS OF THE PAST FEW DAYS WILL OF COURSE
NOT REASSURE HIM RE THE SITUATION HERE.
4. OTHER THAN ARTIME GAMBIT, ONLY TWO POSSIBILITIES FOR
OBTAINING PASSPORT WHICH REMAIN OPEN TU D-2 ARE PERUVIAN CITIZEN-
SHIP OR GOING TO CUBAN EMBASSY AND ASKING THAT THEY RENEN HIS
EXPIRED CUBAN PASSPORT. HE REJECTS IDEA PERUVIAN CITIZENSHIP,
CLAIMING HE STILL PLANS EVENTUALLY RETURN TO LIVE IN UNITED STATES
BUT ALSO BECAUSE HIS FEARS ABOUT ULTIMATE DESTINATION PERUVIAN
REVOLUTION AND POSSIBILITY MARXIST DICTATORSHIP COMING TO PONER
HERE. HE AND STATION ARE NATURALLY RELUCTANT HAVE HIM APPROACH
CURS. THERE PROBABLY THICK FILE ON HIM IN HAVANA AND HE WOULD
NOT HISH CALL THEIR ATTENTION TO HIS PRESENCE HERE. HOWEVER THIS
OPTION MUST BE EXAMINED AND THEREFORE WOULD BE HELPFUL IF HOS

HE CLOSING OUT ALL HIS STATIONKEEPERS IN NICARAGUA, DID
NOT WANT. TO ABANDON WEAPONS TO FALL INTO WRONG HANDS, NOR
TO GIVE THEM TO NIC GOVT. GENERAL SOMOZA KNEW AMWORLD WAS
LEAVING BEHIND SOME RESERVE EQUIPMENT AND WOULD KEEP
ENOUGH WEAPONS FOR LOCAL SECURITY. HE DID NOT KNOW NUMBERS
AND TYPES REMAINING. AMBIDDY-I ASKED IF WOFACT WISHED TO
RECOVER WEAPONS, OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE TO DUMP THEM IN
OCEAN. ZABOTH, AMBIDDY-1 AND AMJAVA-4, WHO IN MANAGUA ON
OTHER BUSINESS, VISITED BLUFF ISLAND 6 MARCH TO CHECK
SITUATION. IF HQS WISHES RECOVER WEAPONS, MOST FEASIBLE
METHOD IS BY AIR. A CARIBOU OR C-123 TYPE AIRCRAFT COULD
LAND ON BLUFF STRIP, LOAD WEAPONS AT NIGHT AND FLY THEM
OUT NEXT MORNING. IF HQS DOES NOT WISH RECOVER WEAPONS,
AMBIDDY-1 COULD BE TOLD TO MAKE OWN ARRANGEMENTS TO DOMP
