Please note
1. Attached per referent telephone conversations is copy of
Dun and Bradstreet report as requested on Hilitary Armament
that Chairman of the Board, is Mitchell Livingston Werbell, m.
Werbell is a former Office of Strategic Services (Oss) officer
known to this writer during assignments in China during WWII.
2. This Agency, as well as other government agencies, have
considerable information on Werbell. He is an old and imsavory,
unsolicited, contact of the Miani Field Office dating from 1959.
He is of dubious character and reputation who had and has been
involved in grandoise schemes and international arus ccals. He has
hed perpetral financial difficulties.
3. Merbell was involved with Poland Jasferrer Senior, in
comection with the abortive Haitian invasica in 1967. This may
throw a different light on possible source development of young
Rolands Jr. Any approach to hir sixuld be executed with some degree
of caution. We do not desire to get involved with Werbell. However,
we cannot foresee any objection to planned debriefings of Masferrer
Jr., following his trips to Latin America and other areas, in pursuit
of FPI and possible information of operational significance.
4. If we can be of further assistance in this matter, please advise.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
A168846
SUBJECT: Assessment of Recruitability Rolando Masferrer, Jr.
Vice-President, Sales, Military Armanent Corporation
and Associated with Defense Systems incorporated
:
A168762
1. Subject seems to have inherited that particular
Latin American penchant for involvement in covert political
activities. However, the Subject's involvement is not merely
naetima or recreation but it is instead intimately connected
with his chosen profession as an arms salesman. Here the
phrase "for fun and profit" sooms aptly suited. He seems
to be a man of action with the ability to exploit an oppor-
tunity, rather than a towering intellect.
2. Subject has excellent contacts and access in
Latin America. This access developed from his extended
family, professional appointments, and his favolenent with
isfasily is well-known (infamous)
Ehroughout any coctors of Latin America and opens many doors
for him (although it also closes others). It should also
be mentioned that his family has recently developed a rather
checkered association with this Agency. The particular
nature of his military products gives him contact with high
military, police. and security officials throughout Latin
America. He sees to be well versed on the status of various
arus deals (both official and under-the-table) in the
countries he travels. He has been involved with several
Cubari exile political and para-military organizations.
3. Politically, Subject is a staunch anti-Communist.
This position is probably ingrained from his family, but
also reinforced from his various political and professional
activities. He as voiced a particular hatred for Cuban
Communists. He seems to view them not as respected enemies,
but as hated traitors. He is vehemently anti-Castro.
14-00000
Subject has developed what could be interpreted
as a certain patrictis: for this country. Juriaz conver-
Satis de referred a few times to my country meaning
the 3.5. I relieve that the fact he volunteered for 1.S.
military training reflects not only the selfish natives
of lecssing Special Forces qualified et also a sense of
duty. I aiso believe that is recent statements to me
regarding international security matters is not merely
empty Loquacity but is evidence of his desire to contribute
something and becere involved in the rational interest.
$
5. Subject would need sober biefings on the
responsibility of any Agency association as well as subse-
quent careful handling. ne would need to get avey fron
the "Flagler Street Commando syndrome" of visual and verbal
travado. He would need instruction to discern zor from
ract, to identify sources, and to assess the matini
of acquired information.
:
6. I am sure that the Subject is recruitarle. The
question is what degree of association with the agency
would be appropriate. If the decision is made to approach
the Surject, may I suggest that his association be initially
limited to Agency briefings and debriefings before and after
his trips to Latin America. Dace his reliability is established
and the accuracy of his reporting is proven then further
utilization may be possible. Since his financial situation
seems to be secure I am sure he could be handled on a non-
pay basis..
7. Subject is scheduled to leave on a two-week business
trip to Venezuela and Colombia beginning in early August 1972.
lie claimed to have appointments with a Venezucian Air Force
Goneral and with Venezuelan national security officials in
DISIP.

his intelligence potential and explain the DCS mission,
wichout revealing in any way the past relationship with
ür. Peterson. Subject's personality profile appears to
be very interesting.
4. It appears that the Clandestine Service is not
repeat not interested in subject's operational potential
at this time. We leave this in your capable hands to
determine what course of action you may wish to contem-
plate in this matter.

SUBJECT: Rolando MASFERRER, Jr.
12 June 1972
1.
Please be informed of a possible future contact--Rolando
MASFERRER, Jr., recently promoted to Vice-President of Sales, Mili-
tary Armament Corporation, Washington D.C. office, 905 L' Enfant
Plaza, #4020. He is also associated with Parabellum Corporation,
another military weapons firm. Subject, born approximately 1945,
in Habana, Cuba, is believed to be a naturalized citizen.
2.
=>
Subject makes frequent sales trips to Latin America. Because
of the nature of his main product(zachine pistols with silencers) he
has good access to top Latin American governmental officials and
military and security officers. He has personally met many Latin
American presidents. He should be a good source of information on
the current status of arms sales in Latin America; internal security,
military armament levels, order-of-battle, and internal politics in
host countries; and, if needed, status of Cuban exile movement.
is presently on a sales mission to Colombia and is scheduled το return
in mid-June.

He
3. MASFERRER, Jr. has been a Miami resident since 1959 and more
recently lived in Atlanta. He will permanently locate in the Washing-
ton, D.C. area when he returns from his Colombian trip.
4.
Subject is not to be confused with his father by the same
name, the infamous Rolando Arcadio MASFERRER y Rojas (201-42669).
Masferrer Sr. was a former Cuban Senator and leader of a dreaded.
private army of Batista enforcers called "Los Tigres (The Tigers)".
He is presently serving in a U.S. federal prison for attempting
to organize a 1957 invasion of Haiti in order to set up a base
of operations against Cuba. Masferrer Sr., violently anti-Castro,
was involved in numerous Cuban exile operations against Cuba during
the last decade.
5.
I was Subject's Commanding Officer in the Florida National
Guard and sometimes saw him socially while in Miami. Although Cuban
by birth, he now feels that he is an American. Politically anti-
Communist, he joined the National Guard (while not under duress from
the draft) to become a "Green Beret." He is polite and correct in
his social relationships. I received a letter from him, 7 June 1972,
informing me of his impending move to the Washington, D.C. area. He

solicited my aid in finding a iccal asky Soive unit.
6. If you are interested in exploring this possibility further,
please feel free to contact me at any time. I could suggest cautions
and method of contact or introduction. Subject is unwitting of my
Agency employment.
