OCCURRENCE: In a Presidential meeting on Vietnam with the CIA participants
being McCone and Colby the record by Colby reflects that McNamarra pointed out that
Lodge has little contact with Diem and has not been out of Saigon. Mr. McCone commented
that he believed that we should move cautiusly, that we should talk seriously to Diem
and that Lodge should be urged to visit the countryside to obtain a more realistic
view of the effects of suspending aid. Mr. McCone also suggested that another approach
be made to Nhu to seek his cooperation ina departure. The President asked whether we
had carefully studied the detail effects of cuts in aid (as proposed in a paper prepared
by Hillsman). It was evident that the effects had not been studies. The President
asked DOD and CIA to analyze the Hillsman paper. He also asked that a telegram be sent
to Lodge asking him to try to reduce the press leakage from Saigon and to establish some
real contact with Diem. Any current plans for aid negotiation should be stalled, and the
PresidenOURCEould be well informed of any steps taken in this contex TAFFsuch as the
instance involving CIA payment to Col Tung last week.

to Saigon, MC CONE was called over by PRESIDENT KENNEDY and met privately with PRESIDENT
KENNEDY and the Attorney General, ROBERT F. KENNEDY, and took the position that the CIA
should take a hands off position as far as the assassination of DIEM was concerned. MC CONE
"felt that the President agreed with my position, despite the fact that he had great reser-
vations concerning DIEM and his conduct. I urged him to try to bring all the pressure we
could on DIEM to change his ways, to encourage more support throughout the country. My pre-
cise words to the President, and I remember them very clearly, was that Mr. President, if I
was manager of a baseball team, I had one pitcher, I'd keep him in the box whether he was a
good pitcher or not. By that I was saying that, if DIEM was removed we would have not one
coup, but we would have a succession of coups and political disorder in Vietnam, and it might
last several years as indeed it did. So it was for that reason that I felt there would be

best line is no line so that it is clear that we are sticking to position of having no

other hand, we are in no way responsible for stopping every such threat of which we might

GENERAL meant, he actually did not want U.S. participation in the coup d'etat. He did not
want the U.S. government to start the coup d'etat. He also outlined three general ideas,
this was the first time that a leader had mentioned the possibility of assassination. This
assassination was not of DIEM. This was if they could not do anything, it would be the
elimination of NGO DINH CAN, who was the war lord in central Vietnam and NGO DINH NHU.

"At 0745 hours, RICHARDSON, SPERA and CONEIN, latter two of whom were scheduled to contact
GENERALS MINH and KHIEM at 0815 same morning, were shown a message from GENERAL TAYLOR to
GENERAL HARKINS stating aspects of Vietnam situation being reviewed at WHITE HOUSE and com-

given strictly limited time factors, RICHARDSON decided that the meeting with GENERALS MINH

The I.G. REPORT of 1967 (CIA) contains the following, description of the events of August 25,
1963, from a book by MARGUERITE HIGGINS: "The crucial act, with its overtones of Greek
tragedy, opened with a cable. It was dispatched to Saigon late in the evening of August 24,
1963, a date made more significant because it was a Saturday. Washington usually empties on
summer weekends or lapses into a somnolent mood as officials desperately seek relaxation.
"The telegram contained spectacular new instructions for the U.S. EMBASSY in SAIGON.
It was drawn up at a meeting called by Under-secretary of State AVERELL HARRIMAN and ROGER
HILSMAN, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs and head of the Vietnam task
force. The President's senior advisers were, for the most part, out of town. CIA DIRECTOR
JOHN MCCONE was in California. DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT MCNAMARA was on vacation.

SECRETARY OF STATE DEAN RUSK was attending a baseball game in New York. PRESIDENT KENNEDY
was at Hyannis Port. GENERAL TAYLOR says he knew nothing of the meeting until it was over
and the telegram long on its way.
"... the cable proved historic. For the first time it gave the signal to
'unleash' the Vietnamese military, flashed a green light for the coup against DIEM of which
the generals had been talking for so many years.
"...the cable of August 24 was a radical revision of the previous philosophy
of one war at a time. It envisaged the generals' making war on their own government, and
with the implicit blessing of the United States.
"The substance of the cable was that the U.S. EMBASSY was to make an effort (con't.)

restore other democratic liberties suspended under martial law. And if, as the cable antici-

and tell them that the United States would no longer stand in the way of a revolt.

Thich Tri Quang and others had run their political war against the Diem regime.
According to Higgins, Thich Tri Quang told an Austrian journalist by the name of
Denis Warner early in August that he hoped in the process "they would kill one or two
of us."
Higgins goes on to note that the State Department regarded the actions against a dozen
pagodas a betrayal of Diem's promise to reconciliate the Buddhists.

Higgins claims that "...the raids by the Vietnamese Army and the pagodas took place
five days after the departure of Ambassador Milting from Saigon, and a week before Henry
Cabot Lodge was expected to arrive on his first tour of duty in Viet Nam." Higgins goes
on to explain that Diem claimed that the reason that the raids were performed at this
time was because: "It had become clear that Thich Tri Quang of Buddhist was that no
intention of coming to any agreement with the government, irrespective of how many
concessions were made. Since the raids would create an anti-Diem propaganda explosion,
it would be less embarassingto the United States if they took place when the new
Ambassador was President of Vietnam. For the same reason great care was taken not
to inform the United States of the pagoda plans. The reasoning was that Washington

OCCURRENCE: Diem on May 6, 1963 revived a regulation banning the public display of any
religious flag--either the Buddhist or Catholic-- having any precedence over the National
Vietnamese flag in public places or in public view. Higgins does not doubt that the
Vietnamese government's decision to revive these flag regulations on May 6, 1963 made
possible the Hue tragedy. Ironically, action by Diem has been generally viewed as anti-
Buddhist. His May 6 circular had been provoked a few days earlier in Da Nang by the
excessive use by Catholics of the flag of the Vatican with the National Vietnamese flag
on view being sometimes tattered and torn and few in number. (91)
