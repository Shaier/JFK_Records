enlist support for our operatiン。
Puring the past year, the tas of supervising the
1. Chile Branch has been a most challenging one. Chile
has become a kaotty foreign policy probles, and is the
subject of continuous and extensive discussions between
tihe Agency, the State Departrent, and other components
of the Government, while receiving the attention of tho
rost senior policy makers.
Requirements from many
Girections have required constant pressure to respond
with ideas, methods, proceres and the subsequent
position papers. Through it all Mr. Lilliamson has
maintained a sense of balance and professiomlisa
which permits a proper focus on the crisis of the moment.
We have been fortunate in having an officer of Mr.
Willicason's caliber in this position during such a
difficult period.
In recognition of Mr. Willieson's demonstrated
continuous superior performance as a senior intelligence
officer, which has contributed to the accompli ishment of
the mission of the Agency, it is recommended that he be
awarded the Certificate of Distinction.

Dear Earl:
You have just completed, at my direction, seven weeks
of full-time service on the GS-13 Clandestine Service
Personnel Evaluation Board, I know that this work has been
particularly demanding. Your participation and diligent
application of your professional experience have been
decisive factors in the successful accomplishment of the
Board's missions.
In the course of this assignment you have become
thoroughly familiar with the use and interpretation of per-
sonnel files and personnel practices of the Clandestine
Service. Having reviewed and analyzed the files of one
hundred or more CS officers, you have had to make judgments
and recommendations concerning their relative-ranking and
their qualifications for promotion, for training required
to overcome a deficiency or enhance career effectiveness,
for changes of assignment to further career development and
for Quality Step Increases to recognize outstanding perform-
ance. In so doing, you have carefully studied the career
development of a large number of officers in all components
of the CS, both as individuals and in relationship to each
other in terms of morit and value to the Clandestine Service.
You have become familiar with a broad spectrum of
personnel and administrative problems on a practical working
level and have acquired a knowledge of personnel management
which will better equip you to handle supervisory positions
which require personnel reporting and career development of
subordinates. The committee format of the panels has also
deepened your understanding of the conference approach to
management problems.
Hr. Earl Villiamson
Bu Division
C-O-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-1-A-L
C-O-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L
I wish to commend you personally for your participation
in an evaluation procedure which helps to strengthen the
Clandestine Service Career Service. A copy of this letter
will be included in your official personnel file so that
your supervisors and future Evaluation Boards may make due
note of this service.

MEMORANDUM FOR:
SUBJECT
:
Earl J. Williamson
Foreign Divorce Decree
1. The purpose of this memorandum is to bring certain information
to your attention which relates to the fact that your current spouse was a
party to the dissolution in Mexico of a former marriage.
2. Recently, the Office of General Counsel completed a study of the
validity of a Mexican divorce decree and potential problenis arising from
such a divorce for JKLANCE employees concerned and JKLANCE. A
summary of OGC's study la attached.
3. You will note from the attachment that the employee whose cur-
rent marriage follows a Mexican divorce may be confronted with serious
problems affecting eligibility for payment of various government benefits
such as reimbursement of hospitalization expenses, survivorship benefits
and certain types of overseas allowances. My purpose in writing to you,
therefore, is to be sure you are made aware of and understand the serious-
ness of the problems which would arise in the event of a challenge to the
validity of the Mexican divorce and, consequently, to the validity of the
current marriage. This challenge could arise at any time and from s
number of sources.
4. JKLANCE has another interest stemming from Mexican divorces
and this is one of security, depending upon the employee's specific employ-
ment. In the ovent such a divorce is challenged, subsequent litigation and
attendant publicity become quite probable. It is, of course, in JKLANCE'S
best interest that this sort of activity be avoided where possible.
5. Recognising that there are various types of Mexican divorce, and
also that the various states in the United States have decided cases in different
ways depending on the type of Mexican divorce involved and its own case law,
==End of OCR for page 19==
14-00000
you may wish to discuse your personal situation with your attorney or a rep-
resentative of JKLANCE's Office of General Counsel. In the meantime,
however, JALANCE's position with respect to your situation is that it assumes
the validity of your current marriage, unless the earlier Mexican divorce
action and your current marriage are challenged. 'hould that challenge over
occur, it may be necessary for JKLANCE to determine that your eligibility
for benefits based on your current marriage must be suspended until such
time as the challenge is litigated or otherwise resolved. Special note should
be taken of the fact that such a challenge might arise after your death, possibly
resulting in the distribution of insurance procoods and other death benefits to
other than your immediate family as constituted at your death and contrary to
your own intentions and wishes.
6. Please advise me of your plans and any actions taken in connection
with the above. If you have any questions on the substance of this memorandum
or its purpose, do not hesitate to let me know.

1. The circumstances surrounding Mr. Earl-J.
Williamson's departure from San Jose, where he had
been Chief of Station, are described in the attached
memorandum. Because of the disruptive nature of his
PCS transfer to Washington, Mr. Williamson has requested
an additional ten days of home leave. As he is a State
Department integree, the Office of Finance, subject to
approval of his request, can offset the State disallowance
of his additional home leave and the charge to his annual
leave by adjusting Mr. Williamson's escrow leave account
as appropriate.
2. Due to the nature of his transfer, Mr. Williamson's
request for an additional ten days of home leave appears
to be warranted. In accordance with the provisions of
the referenced regulation, it is recommended that Mr.
Williamson's request for an additional ten days of home
leave be approved.

f. To give the public impression that my departure
was a routine transfer, the Department, the Agency, and
the GOCR agreed to the postponement of my departure
until 21 February 1971.
On 11 February 1971 1 received Department orders
based on my previously requested itinerary for home
leave and reassignment to Washington,
h. My home leave itinerary included five days annual
leave in Mexico onroute and 25 days home leave reporting
for duty on 5 April. I actually arrived in D. C. on 23
March and was fully occupied until 5 April in locating
and renting a homo and getting my family Bottlod.
1. In accordance with Department regulations, I
have boon credited with only 15 days home leave and the
additional 10 days havo beon charged to annual leave.
2. I submit that the circumstances of my departure from
San Jose woro unusual and beyond my responsibility or control.
The delay in departure definitely occurred because of opera-
tional requiroments abroad which negated my original home
leave schedule. I would like to request the granting of an
exception to tho 15 day homo leave limitation to show my
return to duty as of 23 March (the dato I arrived in D. C.)
rather than 5 April the date the Department has me returning
to duty.
