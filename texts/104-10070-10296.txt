HEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT:
Backstopping of Cover by the Research Institute
of America
1. Pursuant to conversations between Mr. Rose and Mr. Engels of
CIA/ope and Mr. Travis of 00/Contacts, an appointment was made for Mr.
Ross to see Mr. Leo Cherne, Executive Secretary of the Research Insti-
tute of America, 292 Madison Avenue, New York City, to explore the
willingness of Mr. Cherme to backstop the cover story of a proposed
agent in training. The appointment was made, and kept, for Wednesday.
morning, 23 January 1952 in New York City in the presence of Mr. Clark
of the New York branch of the Contacts Division.
:
2. The proposed story of the agent in question, who had bein em-
ployed on the economic research side of ECA specializing in Italy, was
that he wished to resign from ECA and take up an offer to be extended
to him in civilian employment. Since the Research Institute of America
ssamed to fit in naturally with his background and activities in ECA,
Mr. Cherne was asked:
a. If he would backstop the agent's story that he was
quitting ECA to take employment with the Pesearch Institute of
America during his three months period of training with CIA,
and
b.
Whether he would in fact employ the agent and send
him as a representative of the Institute to Italy at the con-
clusion of his period of training.
Hr. Cherne replied that unfortunately the latter was impossible
inasmuch as his company did not send personnel overseas in any capacity.
As regards the immediate backstopping of the agent's story, however,
Mr. Cherne said that he would be happy to oblige for a period of train-
ing only, to wit, three months, after which other cover would have to
be sought. Mr. Cherne requested that he be furnished at an early date
with more complete information as to what was to be expected of him
in his role as a backstop and further stated that he would like to
meet the agent personally as soon as could be arranged. This has been
communicated to Mr. Engels, the case officer, who will oblige at the
earliest opportunity.
