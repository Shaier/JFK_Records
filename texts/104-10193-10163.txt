The Conseil de In Resistance in Cherboug is composed of
three main groups: the O.C.M., Liberation and the Front National:
20
The Chief of the Connel de la Real stance, M. Crealin, is an
O.C.E. leader and his organization holds the majority of seats
in the Consell. The O C.M. is generally composed of merchants,
landowner's and notabies who, prior to the armistice, were
Rightists or extreme-Rightists.
Liberation, which claims to have been the most active and
efficient nevement in the Department, is led by and generally
composed of Socialists and C.G.T. τοπ. In fact all the Resist-
ance Socialists and Union men are aembers of Liberation.
As in the rest of France, the Front National is here the
Communist Party's resistance organization. It is not as
influential here as it is reported to be in other regions.
The right hand won to M. Grolit 15 M. Bocher Beauchet),
who seems to be as well the cat prominent labor Teader of the
department. Bocher is at the same time secretary of the Regional
Socialist i ederation, secretary of the lerchant Sailor's Union,
secretary of the Union des Syndicats, representative of the I.T.F.
and head of the local Liberation movement. lle is a very efficient
men and seems to be respected and osteeled by his political
adversaries.

great member of people here are suspicious of Resistance because
of the presence Cartunists apu Socialists. Moreover, they are very
reserved towards foreigners as a rule, and they are not sure of what
tlie Allies intend to do. The are also puzzled about the currency
which has been ir trused. On the part of Labor, there is a sincere
enthusiasm for the victories of the democracies somewhat teapered
by the way local problems are handled by military authorities. For
example, thel Army er the travy have hired dozens of workers to repair
