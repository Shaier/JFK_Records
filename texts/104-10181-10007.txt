Chief Western Hemisphere Division

AMAUTO/Alexander SAMKO

Headquarters agrees that the primary objective of
contact with AMAUTO-1 by a controlled person for assessment
purposes, was well met. We wish to add, moreover, our appreciation
for a seooth job with what could have been a difficult
"controlled asset.
3 COS, WR/Miami
COS, Madrid

* 1.  Forwarded herewith is a contact report from PACHANKIS on his follow-up
Interview of Alexander SANKO (201-866054), which concerns SAMKO's contact with
AMAUTO/1 (201-735296) in Madrid. As can be seen from the report, Madrid Station's
defensive briefing of SAMKO apparently took effect and he has been cautious in
avoiding the many suspicious characters that have appeared since his trip to
Madrid.

* 2.  The question of his writing to MAUTO/1 vas mentioned by SAMKO. He was
told that AMAUTO/1 is back in Cuba and we did not know when he would return to
Nadrid, if ever. 1/Miami believes we should wait until AMAUTO/1 returns to
Madrid, or some other post in the Free World, and then have SAMKO write to him.

* 3.  Despite SAMKO's newly self-discovered James Bond talents PACHANKIS
enjoyed handling him. It also appears that our primary objective, contact with
AMAUTU/1 for a face to face assessment, has been met.
Chief, Western Poetsphere Division

-29-July 1970
Contact Report on Alexander SAMKO, on 28 July 1970.

* 1.  On the morning of 28 July, I called Sam to check in with him.
after being away on TOY for almost 6 weeks. He sounded a bit
upset at not being contacted during this period, so I dashed
out to his Hollywood home to explain what had happened and set
him at ease.

* 2.  It was plain to see that the trip had changed him. He is now
a bit presumptuous, cocky, and know it all James Bond. He told
me all sorts of wild stories about being tailed in Madrid "by
7 or 8 'Chivatos' (Castro agents," and leading them on long
"8 or 9 mile hikes through Madrid." Castro agents were also
"watching" him on the day he was in Barcelona and on the short
layover his Pan Am plane had in Lisbon on his way home. At no
time, however, was he molested by these "agents."

* 3.  The Castro surveillance continued -so Sam says- in Hollywood.
"About the second night after I got home," c. 14-15 June, a car
parked across the street and a little to the rear of his house
"after it got dark." When Sam got into his car and went to the
gas station, the car -described as looking like a white Volkswagen,
without headlights on- followed Sam's car on his short trip in
the neighborhood and back to his home. He could not make out
the physical description of the driver of the VW. He has never
seen this car again.

* 4.  The only other suspicious individual near his home, was "a tall,
thin man," (described as about 5-11 to 6 ft and 170 lbs, black
hair; no distinguishing features visible; once wearing slacks and
white shirt, another time wearing a suit). This individual showed
up across the street from his home "just as the sun had gone down,
several evenings during the first week that I got home." (c. 14-18
June) The man just walked past the front back and forth a few times
and appeared to have his car around the corner of Sam's house. He
could not identify the car or anything else about the man.

* 5.  Again, during the first week after his return Sam received several
telephone calls where no one would answer when the phone was picked
up, or the person calling would say, "sorry, wrong number." Sam
has not experienced any other suspicious incidents after the first
week home from Spain. I should note that Sam does not talk of
these incidents with fear, but rather in the vein of a paperback
detective story.

* 6.. Sam would not admit that he enjoyed himself somewhat in Madrid as
a tourist, although he did not deny that he stayed in a luxury hotel,
ate as well as drank well, saw the sites and even went to a night
club, all on the house. He went so far as to say that if he had
"known"it was going to be like this, I never would have gone." Yet,
in the same breath, he told "William" that he would be back in
Spain in September. Of course, Sam would go again if we asked him,

"but, only to help my country." (With "Patriots" like Sam, how
cân we lose.)

* 7.  Sam is most anxious to start some correspondence to "William."
He says "William" asked him to send him some photos of Cape Kennedy
and some smoked shrimp. Sam wants to know if we want to supply
him with photos of the Cape that he can send. Sam states he will
write anything we wish. I promised to check out the status of the
case with my office and Madrid to see what course of action they
deem should be initiated.

* 8.  Modesty not being one of his greatest virtues Sam rambled and
rambled about the "secrets" he got out of "William" and passed
on to the Madrid c/o. I went along with him and complimented him
on a job well done; which is true. But, he was not satisfied with
my plaudits, he wanted to know "What Washington said?" To which I
said, "everyone, Washington, Madrid and Miami thought you did an
excellent job and we are most grateful for your cooperation." He
liked that very much; you could see it in the smile on his face.
He tries to make it sound like it was a great ordeal and sacrifice
on his part to go to Spain to see "William," but he cannot hide
his anxiety to get on the next plane to Madrid, and the good life there.

* 9.  I pointed out that "William" is now back in Cuba and there is no
indication of when he will return. Nevertheless, Sam feels he
should write him "because the letter will be sent to Cuba to him."
I assured him that I would get a reading on this matter and have
an answer for him sometime next week. At that time, I promised to
take him and his close friend Masip to lunch. Sam gave me an
extensive and expensive expense account of his trip. I will attempt
to decipher it at the close of this report.

* 10.  We ended the meeting on very cordial terms. He was not so mad at
not being contacted so much as he is dying to get back on the gravy
train, and so much time has passed by without word to or from
"William." Sam asked for some way in which he can contact us
"right away" if "Willian" notifies him "that he's ready to jump.
You know when he jumps he won't have much time." I pointed out
that at present "William" is in Cuba and the prospects of him
defecting from Cuba right now are very slim indeed. We would, however,
take this into consideration after "William" returns to Spain or
another foreign post. We will be seeing each other next week to
clear up the accounting (we owe him money, he says) and have lunch.

SECRET
To enforce story that DE LA Nuez out of Spain
Station suggested remaining sum of $175.00 be
sent to DE Fandez Frea New York.

1.  Alexander SAMKO arrived in Madrid on 30 May
and was met by the undersigned at 1700 hours in his hotel room.
SAMKO does not know the true name of the undersigned. He
quickly complained of his flight and said never before has he
flown on a "cattle plane" and avowed never again to fly
Aeronaves de Mexico. PACHANKIS correctly assessed him as a
querulous person. The undersigned was mentally prepared for
his comments regarding the flight, the bad food served on the
plane, and, much later in the week, the hotel room, Madrid in
general and, because of the language barrier, his one-plate
diet of steak and potatoes. He said his return trip would be
through London where he expected to fly the Boeing 747 to
New York. SACODER interrupted him and said that we had-other
plans for him and his only reply was "oh!". Beneath his rough
exterior and use of the vernacular, which is indeed spicy,
SAMKO is a loveable person who has an infinite number of anec-
dotes. Although he had no children, he gives the impression
of being a good, grandfatherly type who could easily put any-
one in a nostalgic mood. After leaving the room we continued
the conversation in the hotel bar. SACODER reviewed the cover
stories and went through a series of do's and don'ts; i.e.,
do try to establish a channel between SAMKO and AMAUTO-1; don't
hesitate to accept an invitation to visit AMAUTO-1's office,
failing all other means to meet with him; do try to invite him
out alone to a restaurant for dinner or to a bar for a drink;
do accept an invitation to have dinner at his home; don't hint
to your sponsorship for this trip. He had no objections to
the cover stories, but embellished them to his liking with

Ruiz is talking with a Cuben who is in Madrid on a scholarship.
They are talking of bringing a teacher from Cuba and Ruiz
says that this would be very difficult. He says that instruction
is given by professors, but education is given by the parents,
and what the children will bo depends on this education.
Ruiz says that his father made him a communist. Of all the
children, he was the only one that studiod, but it was his
father that formed them all. From the time he was a small
child his father gave him books of Lenin to read. These books
arrived clandestinoly to Cuba. He remarks about problems his
own children have given him. He refers to an incident where
one of the children was invited to a First Communion, and
speaks of the freedom he gave the child to make his First
Communion also, if he wanted to.
Then Ruiz says that his other son "ALEJANDRO, is inclined to
romain in Spain, and he is willing to let him if this is what
the boy wants. He says that these things have to core fron
one's own self, and if they are opposed in these actions it
can loave marks on them for the rest of their lives. Ruiz
says he gives them the liberty to choose.
Ruiz telk this student with whom he is conversing that Alejan-
dro DE LA NUEZ has gone to the United States, and adds that
De La Huez' wifo never came to meetings or reunions that
were held at the embassy. Sho always gave as an excuse that
her nerves were bad. Ruiz says that De La Nuez took the money
with him.
This comrade (F) left at 12:15. Ho said goodbye to her very
cordially. Apparently around the 29th of the month she is
going to Paris.
Later Ruiz entered the office again and put the radio on very
loud. He didn't leave the office all morning, but the radio
continued to play very loud; so much so that you can hardly
tell when anyone goes in or out of the office.
Report 345
Apparently they have received a document in which all the Chiefs
of Mission have been called to Cuba for the third week of July,
as some of them can make it coincide with their leave. He tells
Curbelo that he intends to send Hilda either before or after he
leaves.

Report 351(continued)
rovaltios from the song throughout the world, which have boon
calculated at between $750,000 and $1,000,000, and although
this amount will have to be divided among many things, something
would fall to them..
Ruiz says to work abroad they have to or should send people of
the greatest trust, otherwise it is betterthat they remain in
Cuba. If thoro isn't complete confidence it is a constant
struggle with the capitalistic life, money, the stores, the easy
life. They mention De la Nuoz, and Ruiz says if he's gone he's
gone, but the interesting thing would be to know what motivated
him; his wife, his son, or money. He says that it has caused
a great impression here, and that no one even imagined such a
thing. Only two days before he had been in the study circle
with all of them.
A girl that is in this moeting with Ruiz says that De la Nuez'
daughter is married to Juan Antonio GARCIA, who is Head
of Government..., that he has beon proposed for ambassador (Ruiz
says that they will now have to reconsider this), and what they
all three agree on is that De la Nuoz was not to blame,
Ruiz mentions the letter from De la Nuez' son in which he says that
his father has betrayed therm. They also mention an ambassador
who has left (for Cuba-?) and took watches as gifts to everyone
in the Ministry. Ruiz thinks that some of them will remain here
in Spain as they have a great deal going for them there.
Report No.352
Ruiz is very displeased. He speaks to Horacio about how badly
some of the comrades speak of him when they return to Havana.
He asks him if he remembers the name of one of these comrades
that spoke badly of him last summer when he was there on vaca-
tion. It was someone named COLON and another one that soon left.
After what COLON said they wrote him a letter calling his atten-
tion to the criticism. Ruiz is very worried about his re-call
to Havana. He tells Horacio that ho doesn't think it is about
his work, and Horacio says they are doing things there that are
super-human, that without the necessary means at hand they are
resolving difficult problem of various kinds. Ruiz mentions
contacts that he has had in Spain with different people, and he
never has committed an error, and has always handled everything
with great tact and in favor of his government, even when he has
had to deal with Falangists.
Ruiz says that he is very sensitive and that things have got to
the point that he can't just lot them go by, things they are
accusing him of in Havana. But, there is no one that has the
courage to tell him directly to his face so that he could
justify himself, and if they are things that he cannot handle then
for them to call him back, and relieve him of the post because
"Cort andante Guillermo Ruiz cannot resolve them, but the thing is

Report No.352(continued)
that the Minister doesn't want to receive him or listen to
him when he goes there. Horácio says that the worst of it
Is that here in Spain there is always some personality from there
that they have to o tertain, someone irmortent, and that the
attention they need is continual, and sometimes it is necess-
ary to attend to the people here in Spain, which prevents
thon from attending those who arrive from there, but they
don't understand this.
Ruis
He continues to talk with Horacio and he is indignant.
days that ho has been in the Revolution since he was twenty
years old, when he began to think for himself. He says that
he belongs to no party, none other, that is, but the Cuban
communist party. He says that the situation is becoming so
uncomfortable rogarding him, and he doesn't like it at all.
He says he puts everything he has an all the care possible
into doing his job.
"Ruiz says that one never knows about these things in Havana,
and that it is possible that he won't be returning. In the
ovent that this should happen, he is going to leave Horacio
officially in charge, so that he will represent him during
his abscence.as Charge do Affairs, and if he returns ho will
notify the Spanish government officially. He wants semoles
or models of the passports to take with him, and thon he
tells Horacio that if he has not returned by the 18th of
July, that he should reprosent him at the official recention.
Ho gives Horacio instructions as to what to wear, what the
official coremonies are and just what they consist of.
Report No.354
Ruiz speaks to someone that calls and gives him a rosange
which annoys Ruiz. Someone has called the Provincial Depart-
mont of blic Health of Santander saying that they (the Cubans)
use "boric acid" in the stoves(?) which they export. They
give him this message in the name of the Commercial Office of
Cuba, they have a Latin-american accent, and say that they
would take adequate measures so that no stove would be shipped.
Ruiz says to Horacio that he doesn't have time to take care
of this matter, and for him to accompany Franco and go to the
General Department of Security and rake charges about the
telephone call which is interfering with the trade between
Cuba and Spain. He says to go right up as far as the Coneral
Director if necessary, not explaining the "boric acid" one way
or another, but simply as to the malicious call which was
made in the name of the Cormercial Office of Cuba. This can
cause a delay of six or eight days in the departure of a ship
while this call is being explained in Public Health.

12. On the morning of 6 June AMAUTO-1's wife called
SAMKO and, in English, said that her husband would pick him
up at 1400 hours-in front of the hotel. At the appointed
hour, AMAUTO-l's official vehicle pulled up in front of the
hotel driven by a chauffeur. AMAUTO-1 greeted SAMKO in front
of the hotel and after exchanging a few words, they departed
for a nearby restaurant. (SAMKO was too preoccupied to make
note of the name of the restaurant. We decided against any
surveillance during the AMAUTO-1/SAMKO meeting to avoid alerting
AMAUTO-1 and/or his staff that the SAMKO visit to Madrid
was pre-planned.)

13. At lunch SAMKO and AMAUTO-1 again reminisced.
They discussed the following:

* A.  In one of his references, AMAUTO-1 said
that men like him are needed in Cuba and
noted that he would probably die fighting
for Cuba which is young and aggressive,
but that some day it will be a great
country; that he has been fighting all
his life to relieve the oppressed and
repeated that he will die fighting.
  (It is interesting to note SAMKO's reaction
here to AMAUTO-1's statement. When SAMKO
first visited AMAUTO-1 on 31 May, he was
certain that under the facade of being a
devoted revolutionary AMAUTO-1 was indeed a
capitalist at heart, but at this meeting
SAMKO modified his comment by adding that
it appears AMAUTO-1 is truly a communist
who maintains strong convictions of the
righteousness of the revolution. The above
comments by AMAUTO-1 produced the peg on
which SAMKO could have questioned the veracity
of AMAUTO-1's statement on freeing the
oppressed, but he was not specifically
instructed to maintain a polemic argument
on the rights and wrongs of the revolution
because we felt this objective was secondary
to the re-establishment of a relationship
between these two old friends, A future
meeting might include the exchange of an
objective appraisal of the revolution as
seen by SAMKO.)

* B.  AMAUTO-1 proposed that SAMKO act as an
intermediary for the sale of Cuban sea food
in the United States. He explained that
the Cubans have a large fishing fleet in
the Canary Islands. The fish caught is
processed in the Canary Islands and can be
shipped to the United States as a product
of Spain, not of Cuba. AMAUTO-1 added,
"SAMKO, you're like a father to me, please
think about it (the agency)? AMAUTO-1
explained that SAMKO could earn about $200,000
a year in commission based on sales of
$2,000,000. SAMKO said he would think about
it, but privately to SACODER he said that
he had no intention to disturb his retirement
with a fishy business.

C. SAMKO gave AMAUTO-1 a new Kennedy
half-dollar which delighted AMAUTO-1.

D. SAIIKO told ALITO-1 that he expected
AMAUTO-1 to be bigger than just an
ambassador to Spain. He said, "I want
you to get to the United Nations."
SAMKO repeated his desire to show
AMAUTO-1 his Florida home and spend a
few days at the beach with him. AMAUTO-1
again was visibly moved with this idea.
a good friend, don't forget it. You are
like a son.
E.
SAMKO restated that "Bill, you have a

* F.  They exchanged addresses. SAMKO had
printed his address, but AMAUTO-1 asked
him to write it on another piece of
paper. AMAUTO-1 reasoned that he wanted
it written to understand it better, but we
believe he will use the sample to compare
it with letters SAMKO might send in the
future. They promised to write to each
other. SAMKO was given AMAUTO-1's private
address, not that of the embassy.

* G.  AMAUTO-1 regretted that SAMKO had to
leave so soon because he would have
enjoyed showing SAMKO the Spanish
interior. SAMKO said he might consider
returning near the end of 1970, but
AMAUTO-1 did not say whether he would
be in Spain in late 1970.

* H.  AMAUTO-1 said he was suspicious when
he first saw SAMKO noting that the nature
and importance of his position make him
act suspicious, but the suspicion soon
dissipated so he said.

14. On saying their last goodbyes at the hotel, both
men embraced and again promised to keep in touch through
correspondence. At this point the operation was over. SAMKO
was met late that evening. He was taken to a new safehouse.

15. Accomplishments: We feel the objectives programmed
and rehearsed were successfully fulfilled, perhaps far greater
than our own expectations. Unless we are misjudging the shrewd-
ness of AMAUTO-1 through our own naivete, we believe the
relationship was sincerely re-established and a channel opened
for future use by AMAUTO-1 should he desire to use this channel
other than to maintain a friendly correspondence. It was un-
fortunate that his Barcelona trip interfered possibly to the
point of SAMKO having one or two additional meetings with AMAUTO-1
nonetheless, in the six plus hours together, SAMKO admirably
fulfilled our requirements and courageously maintained the
fiction of his visit to Spain. We believe too, that although
AMAUTO-1 appears to be solidly in favor of the Cuban regime,
he did not criticize the United States which we feel he might
have done had he suspected that SAMKO's visit to Madrid was
sponsored by the U.S. Government. AMAUTO-1 has come a long
way since his internship as a butcher in the United States and
