The information below was acquired through interro-
gation of CC-4276, Mario Enrique Eugenio MARTINEZ
Delgado, M.D., a Cuban refugee and former resident of Havana
City who left Cuba on 22 December 1969. Subsource is a medical
doctor who was employed at Havana Psychiatric Hospital (Mazorra)
from 1959 to December 1969,

F
a. /Dr/Jose Angel BUSTAMANTE O'Leary
(201-022396), Psychiatrist, studied medicine at
Havana University in the same class as subsource's
father-in-law, Dr. Enrique CASUSO Casuso, M.D.,
employed as an orthopedic surgeon at the Hävana
Psychiatric Hospital. According to subsource's
father-in-law, Subject was very active politically
during his university studies; he belonged to the
Student Left Wing (Ala Izquierda Estudiantil) at
Havana University, which organization followed PSP
directives. When Subject had completed his medical.
studies, he directed his political activities at
the National Medical College and controlled the
College for several years prior to 1959, during
which years he was able to select the presidents of
the College.

b. Subject is President or Director of the
Neurophysiology institute (formerly Higher Nervous
Activity Institute), Academy of Sciences: subsource
thinks that Subject is also Professor of Medical
Psychology at Havana University. Subject is a very
well trained psychiatrist and has always enjoyed
great prestige as such; nevertheless, he has always
been reputed to have very low morals, and in medical
circles is "famous" as a woman chaser. He is widely
reputed to attempt to seduce his female patients and
his colleagues' wives. Major Bernabe ORDAZ
Director of Havana Psychiatric Hospital, considers
Subject to be a vulgar political schemer utterly
lacking in personal prestige among Cuban "new"
Communists; Ordaz has stated that he considers that
Subject wants to control Cuban psychiatric practice
for his own personal benefit.
!
c. When Castro took power, Subject surprisingly
abandoned the Immediate Action medical doctors' party
and joined the recently organized Revolutionary Medical
Party; Ordaz did not join this party until 1960.
In medical circles, Subject is reputed to collaborate
with the DSE in brain-washing activities, but subsource
had never seen any direct indications of such
collaboration.

d./Dr/. Armando *DE CORDOVA
employed as a professor at Havana University, is
a good psychiatrist about 70 years old who has always
been a leftist but is not the type of immoral person
that Bustamante is. De Cordoba and Bustamante travel
together to almost all the psychiatric congresses
held abroad; according to Major Bernabe Ordaz, the two
of them would like to take over the Havana Psychiatric
Hospital, and base their desire on the fact that Ordaz
is not a psychiatrist. In subsource's opinion, they
will never be successful in replacing Ordaz, because
Ordaz enjoys the backing of both Fidel Castro and
Celia Sanchez, who are good friends of his.
He is

a competent psychiatrist and has an office located on
Calle 23, corner of Calle 18, Vedado, Havana City:
In subsource's opinion, he is antiregime although he
speaks in favor of the regime when with proregime
persons, and against the regime when with antiregimo
persons. He does not belong to the PCC cell at the
hospital and is not a militiaman. In an assembly held
at the hospital in 1969 with the express purpose of
increasing the number of members of the PCC cell, no
one proposed Gutierrez as a possible aspirant. Gutierrez
is about 50 years old and was married about February 1969

f. Dr MI GNAGARAY, whose first
name subsource thinks is Ruben, worked at Havana
Psychiatric Hospital (formerly Mazorra) prior to
1959. He is proregime but not an extremist, and
does not appear to be "willing to die for the
regime". Mignagaray was proposed as an aspirant
to the PCC cell at the llospital, in an assembly
held in 1969, but stated that he had a defect
consisting in the fact that he was in love.
Subsource
did not know whether he was accepted as an aspirant.
In mid-December 1969, Dr. Cristino Cabello, employed
as a psychiatrist at Havana Psychiatric Hospital,
told subsource that Mignagaray had told him that he
(Cabello) would have to take over Mignigaray's ward
because he was going abroad to attend a psychiatric
congress; subsource could give no further information
on the congress or Mignagaray's date of departure.
Mignagaray is described as a light-skinned mulatto,
about 5'9" tall, weight about 160 pounds, 60-65
years old, brown eyes, greying hair, married; subsource
thought he had three children.
Martinez,
g. Dr. Lino Bernabe FERNANDEZ
Psychiatrist, joined the anti-Castro counterrevolutionary
forces in the Escambray mountains a few months before
the Playa Giron invasion; he was arrested shortly
before said invasion and sentenced to 30 years in
prison. Subsource had met him when both were students
at Belen High School; their friendship continued at
Havana University, when both were members of the
Havana University Catholic Group, and later as members
of the Movement for the Recuperation of the Revolution
(MRR). Subsource took leave of Fernandez the day that
the latter joined the anti-Castro counterrevolutionaries,
and never saw him again. When subsource visited his
brother-in-law, Enrique Casuso, held first on the
Isle of Pines, then at La Cabana and later at the
Guanajay Jail, he habitually asked for news of
Dr. Fernandez; the information he received made him
believe that Fernandez is one of the most respected
prisoners because of his bravery and equilibrium.
Fernandez was mentioned as an example of integrity.
Other prisoners such as Dr. Andres CAO, Juan
BUSTAMANTE, and Antonio GARCIA told
subsource that Fernandez' attitude had not varied.
Fernandez' wife, Emilia LUZARRAGA who
frequently visited subsource professionally (subsource
was her psychiatrist), also told subsource that
Fernandez' attitude was firmly antiregime: 'Luzarraga
is also antiregime.

jail since before the Playa Giron invasion; he had
belonged to both the Havana University Catholic Group
and the MRR. Subsource's brother-in-law, Enrique Casuso
and Vicky Andrial both told subsource that Dr. Zaldivar
continued to be unyielding in his antiregime attitude.

For your information and possible investigation,
1936, Havana, Cuba, engineering technician who arrived as
rofugee in Spain on 30 January 1970, produced the following story:
gorancisco BOTET Carrion, DPOB: 14 April
:
During the first two weeks of January 1970,
Source's father, Jose F. BOTET who still is in
Cuba told him that he had met in Havana a Dr. MOLINA
Who WAA a physician who has been residing in Chicago,
Illinois for the past 20 years. MOLINA told Source's
father that he had come to Cuba to see the psychiatrist
BUSTAMANTE (Jose BUSTAMANTE O'Leary, 201-022396?)
Who Havana rumors said has been involved in helping,
homo way or other, Cuban political prisoners in
La Cabana, BOTET's father recalled that MOLINA had
A brother who was just finishing a prison term
(he supposed for counterrevolutionary activities) and
fuossed that MOLINA's visit was related to this fact.
MOLINA would not confirm this, nor did he reveal what
means the used to enter Cuba. At the time of Source's
departure, 29 April 1970, MOLINA was still in Havana.
Unfortunatoly, Source could not recall MOLINA's full
name, but remembers having seen him briefly in New York
In 1051. MOLINA is age 63/64, white, 5'8" tall,
170 lbs.
8, In view of the growing number of cases involving attempts
to ransom Cuban political prisoners, it may be that MOLINA is
playing an active role in the release of his brother and possibly
others.
If the BUSTAMANTE concerned is BUSTAMANTE O'Leary,
the Frusted headshrinker of the regime, then this report may
indicate that ho is cooperating, with or without regime knowledge,
in obtaining the release of certain political prisoners.

JOSA RUSTAMENTE O'Leary,
MICROFILMED
OCT 171969
DOC. MICRO. SER.
The information below was acquired through
interrogation of CC-4033, Dr. Hector WILTZ Laneis, a Cuban
refugee and former resident of Nuevo Vedado, Habana, who left
Cuba on 19 March 1969 and has been a professional colleague
of Subject for many years.
href
a. Dr. Jose *BUSTAMENTE O'Leary, psychiatrist,
was brought up by his aunts; he does not know the
identity of his mother. He, together with Raul Roa,
Justo Carrillo, and others, comes from the ranks of
the left wing of the student movement: he joined the
Communist Party of Cuba in 1938 and, in 1944, supported
presidential candidate Dr. Carlos Saladrigas in the
presidential elections held that year. When Dr. Grau
was elected President, Subject concentrated on his
professional activities, earning considerable pres-
tige and acquiring a good practice, while maintaining
his political relationships with senators, colonos,
etc. In 1952, the year of the coup d'etat, Dr. Bustamente
had such friendly relations with both presidential
candidates that, if the general elections scheduled
for June 1952 had been held, Subject would have been
made (a) Vice-Minister of Foreign Relations if Dr. Agramonte
had been elected, and (b) Minister without cartera
(portfolio) if Dr. Hevia had been elected.

b. After the 10 March 1952 coup d'etat,
Subject: opposed the de facto government in
spite of his close relations with Dr. MORALES
del Castillo, who offered Subject the post of
Consulting Counsellor (Consejero Consultivo)
which post Subject rejected. Subject began to
conspire against the regime with Justo Carrillo
and Dr. Araujo, constituting the organization
called the Montecristi Group. Subject continues
to maintain a close relationship with Dr. Araujo,
now President of the Cuban Medical College,
Professor of the School of Medical Sciences of
Havana University, and functionary of the Higher
Nervous Activity Research Institute.
.
c. After the 1 January 1959 Revolution,
Subject hastened to exploit the Communist con-
tent of the Revolution and participated directly
in the denunciation of Dr. Urrutia. One of
Urrutia's assistants was Subject's patient and
informed Subject of events occurring within the
Presidential Palace. Subject then consulted with
Raul Castro and denounced Dr. Urrutia as anti-
Communist.
d. Subject is very intelligent, very com-
He
petent, and an extraordinarily hard worker.
is Professor of Psychology at the Havana University
Medical School, and Director of the Higher Nervous
Activity Research Institute. During the decade
1950-60, he held a high post within the Cuban
Medical College and was President of the World
Medical Group; during this decade he made many
visits to the USA on matters related to his pro-
fessional activities.
e. It has been commented that Subject performed
"brain washing" activities for the Havana DSE.
During the period in 1966 that subsource was held
prisoner at Villa Marista, he did not sec Subject;
subsource has never heard anyone state that he
actually saw Subject at Villa Marista. In subsource's
opinion, if Subject has ever worked for the MININT,
it was probably as professor of psychology in classes
given to MININT personnel; subsource presumes that
the classes would have been similar to those that
Subject gave to Cuban artists.
f. In 1956, Subject acquired an extraordinarily
beautiful mistress that he still continues to visit
and support. This mistress, Manolita Canto, was
divorced by her husband, Salup (fnu), after a private
detective hired by the husband surprised Subject and
Canto in a hotel room in Miami, Florida; subsequently,
U.S. immigration authorities prohibited Subject from
entering the U.S.A. Canto had had one son by her
husband; when her husband died, the son inherited
the father's wealth, which was considerable. The
laws against private property promulgated by the
Castro regime undermined Canto's economic position
to the point that she has had to go to work; she now
works at the INIT (National Tourist Industry Institute),
located at 23 and L Streets, Vedado, Havana City.

Subject surrendered his private practice to the Cuban
Government, and receives only his salary as Director
of the Higher Nervous Activity Research Institute,
which salary amounts to 800 Cuban pesos; this salary
is insufficient to permit Subject to maintain his
own home and his mistress's separate home and to lead
the type of life to which he was accustomed.
g. Subject is described as lacking in normal
affections, cold and calculating, a typical schizoid
interested only in himself, never makes a friendly.
gesture, has almost no friends. Subject is generally
disliked and has many enemies who feel real hate towards
him. The young Revolutionary medical doctors refuse
to have anything to do with him. Fidel Castro does
not know who Subject is and has certainly never been
treated by Subject or received psychiatric treatment
from any other psychiatrist. Subject must be very un-
happy and downcast at his present situation: His
income is insufficient forhis normal mode of life;
he no longer travels extensively abroad (formerly,
he traveled abroad every three months); he holds no
representative office; he is not politically or socially
prominent and, indeed, no one pays him the slightest
attention. Subsource states categorically that he
believes that "Dr. Bustamente would be willing to
accept any offer. He would take the bait if given
half a chance."
h. The trip that Subject made to the USSR in
the early 1960's was a "pleasure trip." So far as
subsource knows, Subject received no training in the
USSR..
Сігвива
i. Subject is not known to have any relations
with SovBloc officials in Havana. He does maintain
close relations: with (Dr) LOPEZ Sanchez (inu), an
old-guard Communist of the so-called microfaction
who holds the post of Secretary of the Cuban Academy
of Sciences.

j. Fidel Castro is a pathological schizo-
paranoid reform-type personality, which personality
type is characterized by latent homosexuality.
k. Raul Castro is just the opposite of what he appears
to be and is more "human" than Fidel Castro; he has
founded a home, takes an interest in his family, etc.

hoarse voice.

that his wife dominates him. His wife suffers from
