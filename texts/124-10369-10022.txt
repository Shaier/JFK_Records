In response to your request, a new closed-circuit
television system was recently installed in connection with
the captioned case. The system consists of a remotely
controlled video camera, zoom lens and pan-tilt head mounted
in a special disguise. A 17-inch monitor is located nearby
and provides a view of the pertinent scene. Monitor personnel
can remotely change the focal length, focus, aperture and
field of view of the lens. Certain compensation for changing
light conditions can also be made at the monitoring site. (5)
Attached is a technical addendum listing the
equipment installed together with special circuit and cable
data to assist WPO personnel in the maintenance of the
equipment. Appropriate inventory changes should be made (4)
