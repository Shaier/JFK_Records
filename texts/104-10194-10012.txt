Retirement Planning
1. In order to assist employees in planning for their even-
tual retirement, it is the practice of the Agency to notify each
employee well in advance of the date he is scheduled for retire-
ment. I am, therefore, taking this opportunity to advise you
that you are scheduled to retire on
5 October
1979.
2. The prospect of retirement from the Agency deserves
serious thought and careful planning so that you may make the
transition to the next phase of life with purpose and confidence.
To assist you in this regard, the Agency offers various resources
which are attuned to the needs of prospective retirees. You
will, in the near future, be invited by the Retirement Counselor
for your Directorate to an individual pre-retirement counseling
session, or more than one if you wish. This phase of retirement
planning will be tailored solely to your own particular situation
and circumstances and will be within the context of the retirement
system under which you will retire. The individual counseling
sessions are intended to give you a wide range of information on
such matters as estimates of your annuity, survivor benefits,
life and health insurance, Social Security, taxes, relocation
and movement of household effects and assistance in obtaining
other employment. In addition, you will be invited to attend a
Retirement Information Seminar that will be offered in the
autumn of 1974.
3. Some persons who wish to retire voluntarily prior to the
scheduled date and who wish to commence their planning as early
as possible, prefer to work with their Retirement Counselor well
before the time he would normally contact them. If you believe
you would benetit from such an earlier start on your personal
planning, you are entitled to contact the Retirement Counselor
responsible for your Directorate at the Retirement Affairs Division,
212 Magazine Building, on telephone extension 3328.

randum by signing below. The original of this memorandum should

Head of IT Career Service
SUBJECT
: Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a
Participant in the CIA Retirement una Disability System
1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment
history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identity
those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA
Retirement and Disability System. In t press, the initial review of
each case is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head of his
Career Service nominates him for participation in the system, this nomina-
tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action
to me. However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee
does not meet the basic requirements of 5 115-ter participation, I have
accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board.
This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening
process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the sys-
tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.
2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that
you do not meet the requirements of 20-5 or designation as a partici-
pant and I have accordingly made the fomal determination required by the
regulation that you are not eligible for designation. From a review of your
record it appears that the decision of your career Service was based upon
the fact that you have 15 years or more of agency service, but have not as
yet perfomed 6 months of qualifying service as required by regulation. My
determination that you are not eligible at this time for designation in no
way affects your current status under the Ciril Service Retirement System,
nor does it preclude reconsideration of your sibility to participate in
the CIA System if you should meet the requirements for designation in the
future.
3. Should you desire further informatica concerning the requirement
for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that
you reai paragraph e of HR 20-50 and paragraçast the Employee Bulletin
dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law --3. The Central Intelligence
Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain evees".
4. It is always possible that the records ugen which the detemination
made in your case may have been incomplete ar inaccurate regarding your actual
employment history with the Agency. It, after studying the materials cited
above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligi-
ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact
officials of your Career Service. They are scilier with the details of your
case and will gladly discuss them with you.
tition, you may wish to dis-
cuss your case with the CIA Retirement State in hocm 08-1329 Fea...
quarters (extension ). 1: suen diseases not revolve my quection.
you have regarding your eligibility, you may est that your case be formally
considered by the Seard. However, this regas: must be made witnia 30 days of
the date of this memorandum.
