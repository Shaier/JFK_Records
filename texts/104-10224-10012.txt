MEMORANDUM FOR: Lee H. Wigren
VIA : Head of Career Service
FROM : B. DeFelice
Acting Director of Personnel
SUBJECT : Retirement Planning
1. In order to assist employees in planning for their
eventual retirement, it is the practice of the Agency to
inform each employee, well in advance of retirement, of
the services the Agency provides for retirement planning.
2. The prospect of retirement deserves serious thought
and careful planning so that you may make the transition to
the next phase of life with purpose and confidence. To as-
sist you in this regard, the Agency offers various resources
which are attuned to the needs of prospective retirees. You
will, in the future, be invited by a Retirement Counselor to
an individual pre-retirement counseling session, or more than
one if you wish. This phase of retirement planning will be
tailored solely to your own particular situation and circum-
stances and will be within the context of the retirement.
system under which you will retire. The individual counseling
sessions are intended to give you a wide range of information
on such matters as estimates of your annuity, survivor bene-
fits, life and health-insurance, Social Security, taxes, and
assistance in obtaining other employment. In addition, you
will-he-rnvited-to-attend_a_Retirement Information Seminar
that will be offered in the autumn of 1978.
3. Experience has amply demonstrated that advance
preparation eases the transition to retirement. I recom-
mend, strongly, that you avail yourself of the services the
Agency offers you in planning your own retirement.

Letter of Commendation
Wo have just completed a high level, sensitive
conference of considerable importance to both this
Directorate and the Agency. You had the responsi-
bility for virtually every aspect of its organization
and administration. The planning sad execution had
to be done with comprehensive attention to detail
without losing sight of our overall objectives.
For
weeks in advance and, particulariy, during the
conference itself you carried out your duties with
energy, skill and competence which have reflected
very croditably upon the Agency. You showed consid-
erable tact and alertness in anticipating problems
before they could ariso. The close and cooperative
relationship you established with the command and
support personnel at the meeting site, and your
obvious rapport with our various guests, also
contributed to the efficient yet cordial environment
in which the conference was conducted. You faced
demanding and often complex responsibilities, and I
commend you for your excellent performance in meeting
them.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, DDO Evaluation Boards
FROM : Chief, Counterintelligence Staff
SUBJECT : Promotion Recommendation for Lee H. Wigren
1. I recommend that Lee H. Wigren be promoted from GS-13
to GS-14. Mr. Wigren has been in grade since May 1962 and is
now a GS-13, Step 8. He currently occupies a GS-15, Operations
Officer, Branch Chief position.
2. Mr. Wigren was born 1 December 1923. lle received a
BA degree in Russian Studies from Yale University in 1947 and
an MA degree in History from Harvard University in 1950. He
entered on duty with CIA as a GS-06 clerk in March 1951. He
subsequently attained professional status as an Intelligence
Officer in 1952 and since that time has served variously as
Intelligence Officer, Area Operations Officer, Biographics
Officer, Instructor, and Operations Officer in DIV/D, Europe
Division, SE Division, OTR, and since 1968 the Counterintelli-
gence Staff.
3. Most of Mr. Wigren's career has involved CE and CI
matters. He has been primarily concerned with various aspects
of the Counterintelligence research and analysis activity of
SE Division and, since 1968, the Counterintelligence Staff.
In the course of his various assignments, he has developed a
broad and deep substantive knowledge of the Soviet intelli-
gence and security organs and their activities which has made
him one of our more knowledgeable and effective CI analysts.
lle is careful and thorough in his research, he writes well,
and he has an established reputation within and without CIA
as an interesting and effective lecturer concerning counter-
intelligence matters. His career record reflects a consistently
professional performance of above-average quality in his vari-
ous CIA assignments. Additionally, that record is documented
by several letters of appreciation from other US Government
agencies and foreign liaison services for the highly profes-
sional assistance provided them by Mr. Wigren in the counter-
intelligence field.

4. Mr. Wigren is currently Chief of the External
Research Branch of the Cl Research and Analysis Group. He
is performing the duties and responsibilities of this GS-15
positiva in a satisfactory manner. He manages the complex
activities of six staff officers and nine contract person-
nel associated with this Branch and is responsible for the
several research programs in which they are involved. He
strives to direct and combine the best talents of the person-
nel under his supervision toward the achievement of his
Branch's objectives while remaining sensitive to the personal
and career interests of his employees. He is especially effec-
tive in dealing with the several contract personnel (including
former defectors) under his supervision who, because of their
professional status and diverse ethnic backgrounds, some-
times require especially understanding treatment.
5. In summary, Mr. Wigren is effectively and satis-
factorily performing the duties of a GS-15 Branch Chief in a
position which requires specialized substantive knowledge
and the ability to manage activities and supervise person-
nel. I believe that his demonstrated ability in this posi-
tion and his sustained record of job performance at an above-
average level since his last promotion clearly merit his
promotion to GS-14 at this time.

Mr. R. Helms,
Central Intelligence Agency,
WASHINGTON DC.
Doar ur Nelms,
During a recent conversation with one of my officers in connection with tho
visit of Mr. Henry Pisanke and Mr. Leo Wigren, it suddenly dawned on mo that although
I had, at the times, coquented both Mr. John Mertz and Monses. Pinuko and Wigren to
convey my sincere thanks and good wishes to you which I am sure they did - I had not
yet written to you personally in connection with the matter.
Hank and Lee, as we affectionatoly remember them, proved themselves to bo
most worthy ambassadors of your country, as well as your service and I feel convinced
tint they left behind them a number of sincere new friends. They are both obviously
experienced officers with a wide and thorough knowledge of their respective fields and
wo found their lectures highly instructive.
Fortunately, circumstances permitted the majority of my senior officers to
attond the course in Pretoria and the lucid manner in which Hank and Lee delivered their
loctures, brought us all under a new and deeper awareness of the vital role being played
by the United Statee in the struggle against international communism, and for the very
great need of unity and closer co-operation amongst the peoples of the free world if the
communist onslaught is to be successfully withstood.
Please once again accept my sincere thanks for having made two such ahie
und oxportenced officers as Hank and Leo available for the purpose of lecturing to us.
Kindest regards.
Sincerely,
H.J, VĂN DEN BERGH.

Dear Mr. Richardson:
It is a pleasure to express the appreciation of the
Staff and Faculty of the U. S. Army Intelligence School
for the presentation by Mr. Lee A. Wigren, at Fort Holabird,
on 8 March 1967, to personnel attending Class 67-SO-2 of the
Senior Foreign Officer Intelligence Course.
Mr. Wigren's discussion of current trends in Soviet
foreign policy was factual and timely. His examples of
Soviet activity in the foreign policy sphere in Vietnam,
the Middle East and Africa were of definite value to this
class. The talk was highly interesting and was enthusiastic-
ally received.
Thank you for your continued cooperation in our guest
speaker program. Would you please convey to Mr. Wigren
the appreciation of the Staff and Faculty.
Sincerely,
RICHARD S. SMITH

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Lee H. Wiren
8 August 1966
THROUGH : Head of Career Service
SUBJECT : Notification of Con-eligibility for Designation as a
Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System
1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment
history and current career field of all employces in the Agency to identify
those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA
Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of
cach case is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head of his
Career Service nominates him for participation in the System, this nomina-
thon is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action
to me. However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee
does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, I have
accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board.
This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening
process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the Sys-
tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.
2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that
you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a partici-
pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the
regulation that you are not eligible for designation. From a review of your
record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon
the fact that you have 15 years or more of Agency service, but have not as
yet performed 60 months of qualifying service as required by regulation. My
determination that you are not eligible at this time for designation in no
way affects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System,
nor does it preclude reconsideration of your eligibility to participate in
the CIA System if you should meet the requirements for designation in the
future.
3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements
for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that
you read paragraph e of IIR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin
dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence
Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."
4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determination
made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual
employment history with the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited
above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not elagi-
ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact
officials of your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your
case and will gladly discuss them with you. In addition, you may wish to dis-
