As you know, the captioned individual has been providing
the Bureau with considerable information, much of it being of a
very sensitive nature. It has been noted that in transmitting

Director of CIA, Attention: James Angleton, in care of E. F. Hall.(5)
Other memoranda dealing with Israeli Intelligence matters ha have (s)
been directed to James Angleton, in care of E. F. Hall (5)
In order that the Bureau would have a uniform procedure
in transmitting mail to Angleton, the Liaison Agent discussed
the matter with Angleton on March 5, 1954. Angleton requested
that in the future mail being directed to him be transmitted to
Sthe Director of CIA, "Attention: James Angleton." Angleton stated
that the above request was being made with the approval of Allen
Dulles, the Director of CIA. He further indicated that he desired
the above method of designation in connection with correspondence
dealing with Israeli Intelligence matters. With regard to Bureau (S)
reports concerning Israeli matters, Angleton advised that such (5)
material is being retained under his personal supervision and
control.
Angleton also asked when the Bureau found it necessary
to disseminate information to him and other agencies, that his
identity not be revealed to the other agencies. He explained that
he is involved in several sensitive projects, such as Israeli
Intelligence, and if his identity were known to the other agencies,
the security of CIA operations could be prejudiced.✓
