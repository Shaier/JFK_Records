Chief of Station, Guatamola City
Tapes Confiscatel by the COG Military
ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
Transmitted herewith please find copies of three tapes confiscated
by the COG military from the guerrilles in operations subsequent to the
guerrilla attack on the call garrison at Panzos (CUAT-4309, paragraph 4).
The tapes were received by the Station from ODISEX in mid-November. The
Etation made copies to pass to the Guatemalan Army and to ODIEEX and kept one
copy for study. The originals were returned to the Guatemalan Army after
a master copy was made.
Judging from the sounds it is felt that the tapes were made indoors by Inex-
perienced personnel. This belief is supported by one of the documents captured
which went into detail on the problems the guerrilira vere having with the
recorder and on how to correct them. The master copy inde by the Stetion
(transmitted herewith) vas recorded at the same speel on three tapes which
total about 16 hours of poor listening.

A. Tepo 1 side 1. Aapooch made by Victor Pigo Galan (Mexican
nevapaperean who is very leftist) to guerrillas under the command of Marco
Antonio You Sose. Generally, he informs the guerrillas tint the revolution
in Guatemale is the revolution of Latin America. He reports that persons
In Latin America at Durope are keenly interested in the Custemslan revolu-
tion and send letters to Calm affirming their support of it. He then goos
into the problems of the apparent split between the 13 November ove sent and
the POT leadership. Se states that the PCT has not given the guerrillas the
proper support sud has taken too soft a line in the revolutionary struggle. He
talked to the rur leadership and asked that personal feelings be set aside and
suggested complete cooperation with the guerrillas to overthrow the present
government. At the end of the tape the guerrilla theme song is sung by a group
of guerrilles.
B. Tape 1 side 2. This side discusses (voice unidentified) the inter-
view Yon Sosa had with nevepaperuen in the Sierre de las Minas. The speaker
explains how the interview van disseminated throughout Guatemala by Supplement
f1 of the Revolution Socialista. The interview will soon be translated into
Genaan, French and other languages and will be sent to Mexico, Letin America
and countries in Europe. The speaker then goes on to explain how the guerrilla
publication, Revolucion Socialista, has created great enthusiasm (does not say
where) and how it will make people aware of the role the guerrillae play in
Quatemala. Its main object is to attack Laperialism and the Quatemalan Govern-
ment.
C. Tepe 2 side 1. This side deals with generalities on the revolu-
tion going on in Quaterala. It discusses the need for a new goverment to
represent the people. It states that the guerrilla movement is the vanguard
of the messce of vorters and campesinos. At the end of the tape it salutes
the workers of the world.
D. Tape 2 side 2. An unidentified voice discusses, in very general
teris, the problems of the guerrillas in shipping various articles (weapons,
literature and tapes) to different parts of the country. The major obstacles
to smooth movements of the articles throughout the country aro police and aili-
tary check points on the major roads and the fact that large truck shipmento
cannot be mounted, foreing the guerrillas to hand carry most of the material.
Through necligence, many guerrillas have been captured with compromising material
in their possession. Pasudonyms are repeatedly mentioned on this side
Rudy, dan, and Matco which cannot be identified by the Station.

8. Pepe 3 side 1. This side is taken up by en unidentified person
reading passages out of Revolucion Socialista and Marxist literature.
F. Tape 3 sids 2. On this side there are discussions of the problem
faced by the guerrillas The first problem is the trouble the Manto General
vas having with the Ostrzelan Coramist Porty (the Farty tended to isolate
itself from the guerrillas). Other problems included communications between
guerrilla unite throughout the country; problems with the recording machine;
and the problen of putting out propagenda which can be understood by the

COS PRIN FROM TAPE
The Lafertation found on the tapes is of no operational value to the
Strtion since it deals with propaganda and guerrilla pro:lems already knows by

leadership to we tapes as a means of operationel communications and to r

conclusions solely on the three tapea transmitted with this report. TvO

tapes from the guerrillas (mids on 8 and 9 December, HOGA-7612) and that
these topes consist of operational problems faced by the guerrilla leadership
and propaganda. The Station vill sttempt to make copies of the tapes went loned
