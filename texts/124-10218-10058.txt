decidedly believe the first assumption is correct.
The CIA directly participated in the destruction
of the Cubana aircraft in Barbados."
--The principal leaders of Cuban exile terrorist:
groups are closely linked through the CORU organi-
zation to CIA activities against Cuba.
In his speech, Castro did not make any specific alle-
gations concerning a USG relationship with Orlando Bosch,
or Luis Posada (two Cuban exile activists who were arrested
by Venezuelan authorities in connection with the Cubana
crash) However, the link with Bosch is implied since he
is reported to be chief of CORU, the umbrella organization
of Cuban exile terrorists.

a. Involvement in Crash: Posada was arrested on
October 14 in Venezuela along with Orlando Bosch and three
others accused of conspiring to sabotage the plane. Posada,
a Cuban exile who is now a Venezuelan citizen, is vehemently
anti-Castro and is suspected of having been the main supporter
of Bosch during the latter's stay in Venezuela prior to being

arrested in November 1974. Posada was formerly chief of the
counterintelligence division of the Venezuelan intelligence
service, DISIP.
b. Relationship with US. X✗ CIA says that Posada was a
paid informant. The relationship was discontinued in July
1967, but contact was reestablished in October of the same
year. When he lost his position in DISIP in March 1974, CIA
says the relationship was "amicably terminated." Though he
was not paid thereafter, CIA continued to have aặccasional
contact with him until February 1976 when a formal written
agreement of termination was signed. The latest contact
between CIA representatives and Posada occurred in June 1976
when CIA declined to assist Posada on a visa matter. (S)

Orlando Bosch
a.
Involvement in Crash: As noted above, Bosch was
arrested in Venezuela for alleged involvement in the Cubana
crash. In late June, a CIA source reported that an exile
group headed by Bosch planned to bomb a Cubana flight between
Panama and Havana.
An FBI source has alleged that one attemp
was made but the bomb did not detonate. A second try occurred
in Jamaica on July 9, but the bomb exploded before the suit-
case in which it was carried was put aboard the plane
(5)
According to CIA sources, Venezuelan President Carlos
LHM

Andres Perez is said to be sympathetic to Bosch and has
permitted him to travel freely in the country and solicit funds
with the understanding that Venezuela would not be used as a
base of operations or place of refuge. Bosch reportedly promised
not to engage in terrorist activity while in Venezuela, and
received a token $500 contribution from Perez. Another CIA
source reported that after Bosch's arrival in Caracas in September,
he stated during a fund raising dinner that "Now that our
organization has come out of the Letelier job looking good, we
are going to try something else." A few days later, Posada
allegedly said, "We are going to hita Cuban airliner" and
"Orlando (Bosch) has the details.".
b. Relationship with US. (CIA says there are no current

Frank Castro
Frank
a. Involvement in Crash:
Venezuelan officials reportedly
believe that Castro, (head of the FLNC terrorist organization,
a component group in CORU) is deeply involved in the crash,
though we have no details of his supposed involvement.
Castro was in Venezuela in late September 1976 and in mid-
October was back in Miami.. Frank Castro has admitted to FBI
agents that he met with Bosch in Caracas on September 26 or
27, but denies any personal knowledge of the bombing of the
Cubana plane.
(S)
b. Relationship with US; CIA says there are no current
or recent agency contacts with Frank Castro, who is an
American citizen with permanent residence in Santo Domingo.
Orlando Garcia and Ricardo Morales Navarrete
a. Involvement in Crash: Orlando Garcia is President
Perez' security and intelligence advisor, and Morales is Garcia's
deputy; both are Cuban exiles who are now Venezuelan citizens.
(5)
A A CIA source claims that Garcia was directed to protect and
assist Bosch during his stay in Venezuela. ( Another CIA source (5)
reported that Garcia and Posada met Bosch upon his arrival and
escorted him to his hotel. Both Garcia and Morales reportedly
attended the fund-raising dinner during which Bosch allegedly
made the remark about the "Letelier job," and after the Cubana

crash Garcia may have made an effort to get Bosch out of
Venezuela. It is possible, therefore that Garcia and/or
Morales may have known in advance about the operation which
led to the bombing of the plane.

Relationship with US:
Felix Martinez Suarez
a.
Involvement in Crash: None, except by the alleged
association with Ricardo, contained in Fidel Castro's charges.
b. Relationship with US: (CCIA says that Suarez was a
CIA media asset from 1961 to January 1974 when he was
terminated as a result of his exposure in the Venezuelan media. ](5)
Castro's allegation regarding CORU: With regard to
Castro's charge on CIA links with CORU, an FBI report of
September 17 states that "a confidential source abroad" claims
to have been told by Roberto Carballo (leader of the Association
of Veterans of the Bay of Pigs, AVBC, one of the component Mexico
cary
organizations of CORU) that in July of this year Carballo and
three other Cuban exiles had been approached by representatives
