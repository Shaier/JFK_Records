ABSTRACT
HEF HAMA 20305, 3 December 1962
1. Reference problem was discussed by KURIA with David N. WILSTED,
during the latter's TDI at Headquarters in early December 1962.
2. KURIOT recommends the following solution and has furnished the
attached material for delivery to ILSTED for his use:
a. The terminal identification system consists of two fluids.
Vial "A" is collodion in which is mixed a small amount of phenolphthalein
and is intended to be used by the person who originally connects the wires.
Generously daubed on the end of the screw, this solution dries almost
immediately in a water repellont, invisible coating.
b. The second vial "B" contains household ammonia. If the bauber
in this bottle is drawn down the row of terminals in the connection box,
the tip of any screw which was previously treated with the phenolphthalein
will immediately turn a dark red color and then will vanish after a minute.
The ammonia can be reapplied and this reaction will repeat itself a couple
of times before more phenolphthalein has to be reapplied.

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES
Action: See below.
1. The purpose of this dispatch is to request Headquarters' assistance
In a problem involving clandestine markings for terminals in a telephone cable
cross box,
2. Specifically, it is destred to have the capability of recognizing which
cable terminals in a box are being used for telephone tapping without having any
markings apparent to unauthorized persons, This system is needed for use in
the event that taps must be disconnected quickly under the threat of a possible
security problem,
3. The tap connections are made by LIFEAT telephone company per-
sonnel and the terminals could be marked by them at the time the tap is made,
The connections sometimes have to be removed by another person who is not
familiar with the commections.
4. It is felt that a quick drying, transparent glue or lacquer that would
fluoresce brightly under UV illumination would be appropriate. A material that
could be removed later by wiping or chipping it away would be desirable but this
characteristic is not vital,
5. The system must be usable in open shade, although some additional
shade might be had by partially closing the doors of the box, and the light source
must be portable and if possible have the appearance of an ordinary flashlight.
The light source can be brought within two inches of the terminals,

1. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSFHB-н
52-6-1, section V, paragraph 2 (d) (1).
A. EXPLOITATION OF LEADS
(1) LIFEAT/Soviet Daring the reporting period, LIFEAT coverage
of Svyatoslav F. KUZNETSOV provided an important and valuable check con-
firming the reporting of a number of KUBARK controlled double agents targeted
against this Soviet officer. Also, coverage of the Soviet Bulletin Office, al-
though not considered vital, does complete Station coverage of the Soviet
target and does provide daily information on the activities and contacts of the
Bulletin Office personnel.
(2) LIFEAT/Polish
LIFEAT continued to provide vital Information
concerning the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation with coverage of both Individuals
and their daily activities.
(3) LIFEAT/Yugoslav Besides the usual coverage of day-to-day
activities of the official installation, LIFEAT leads have indicated the possi-
bility of a successful recruitment of a Mexican employee of that installation,
LIFEAT information will become even more valuable for continuing assess-
ment of the potential agent and forming of a plan for approach to the Mexican
In question.
(4) LIFEAT/Communist Party Coverage in this area gave Station
its first information concerning the second arrest of LINLUCK, as well as
providing sonie information on important persons in the Mexican Communist
movement.

(5) LIFEAT/Exile LIFEAT provides continuing coverage of the
daily activities and contacts of juan Jose AREVALO Bermejo, Although most
of the leads gathered will depend on future exploitation, one contact with an
ODYOKE official was noted by LIFEAT (see reference b).
(6). LIFEAT/Cuban Of late, much of the emphasis of the LIFEAT
operation has been directed toward support of Station operations in this area,
Coverage included monitoring of the activities of AMSTET-1 for the interested
Case Officer. This information provided daily leads for the Case Officer in
his contacts with AMSTET-1. LIFEAT also covered three lines in support
of the AMSTRUT operation. Of this support the interested Case Officer has
noted LIFEAT provided very valuable coverage of the important AMSTRUT
operation during October. The coverage gave valuable operational leads
_ and resolved what would otherwise have been areas of uncertainty or
groundless suspicion. This allowed the case officers to move with more
certainty in developing the operation than would otherwise have been prudently
possible. It is noted that LIFEAT's continuing coverage is proving to be most
helpful.
(7) LIFEAT/American Communists LIFEAT continued to provlie
information of interest to ODENVY. Travel and contacts of the ACGM are
particularly worthwhile.
(8) LIFEAT/Miscellaneous LIFEAT continued its coverage of
former Station asset LIVESTOCK-2. This was in keeping with Station's
policy of making perlodic checks of the activities of former, potentially
dangerous agents.
It should be noted that It is the Station's opinion that LIFEAT'S
excellent overall service, plus its ability to provide unilateral coverage of
targets of opportunity on short notice (sometimes on as little as two hours
notice), make LIFEAT a dependable daily contributor to the fulfilling of the
Station's mission,
B. PROCESSING OF TAKE
No change from previous report.
C. LIAISON
During the month of October the two playback recorders used by
the ODENVY processor broke down. These were repaired by the LIFEAT
technician, David M. WILSTED, ODENVY continued to process take from
the LIFEAT/American Communists in Mexico lines,
:
D. SECURITY
There have been no known adverse security incidents effecting the
LIFEAT operation during the reporting period. LIFEAT meeting sites con-
tinue to be changed periodically. The fourteen regular and six alternate
sites used for daily contact between the Station Case Officer and WILSTED
and Wayne C. DRABAND are considered adequate. Numerous meeting sites
are used for contacts between WILSTED/DRABAND and the basehouse keepers.
E. TECHNICAL.
Audio and dial tape recorders ordered by the Station in support of the
LIFEAT operation began to arrive at the end of October. These were placed
in immediate service. It is noted that the automatic tape stop on the new
model Revere audio recorder has thus far proven to be of no use to the operation

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SURJECT: DSARIEFING OF DAVID H. WILSTSD (pa)
:
5 June 1960
:
1. On 1 June 1960 Mr. John G. Heyn and Mr. John Kennedy of win,
Mr. Robert Brown of CI/OFS, Hr. Robert Bryant of FI/OPS and Mr. Charles
Bray of FI/D met with David N. WILSTED (ps).
2. WILSTED omphasised that the whole telephone systen in Mexico
City is undergoing a reformation. The company Telefonos de Mexico, S.A.,
has sub-contracted this work of cleaning up and reorganising the phone
system to the independent fira, Intel. They are cleaning unused and
old lines, putting in new and spare lines, redefining exchange areas,
laying underground cables, etc. Eventually we should be better off be-
cause there should be more surplus lines. The renovation work hás
hampered much of the LIFEAT work, principally because mary of the lines
now are underground and we cannot get access to them before they enter
the central. This is particularly true with respect to the Coach Em-
bassy, to whose telephone lines we cannot obtain access from the vantage
point we now occupy.
3. WILSTED said that we try to keep track of the activities of
"Intel" but since they seen to attack "Colonias" at randon, we have no
prior warning of their presence in a certain area..
4. In the recent past, Mexico has been using houses for listing
posts for security reasons. We have more control over the access of
phone company inspectors or repairman to houses. However, under new
regulations, all new apartment buildings must have, telophone lines in-
stalled in the building by the phone company during the construction
phase. This means that the lines and their destination are concealed.
WILSTED proposed that this will mean we can again use apertoenta since
we can siphon off a line destined for use by another tenant in such a
way that the phone company cannot trace its destination without tearing
the building apart and we can then install a separate line to the build-
ing and hook up the subscriber to this line which, if checked, will
belong to a legitimate subscriber.
5.
One system which has been used effectively is to take one-half
of two separate pairs which have one faulty line each. These two lwilf
pairs then form one good pair which we can use.
6. WILSTED explained that it cost about 3000 pesos to get a.
reguler telephone. This entails the purchase of a telephone company
bond, which later can be sold.

before office hours by RAFANBILLI. Ho only enters one basehouse which is
occupied by an elderly couple. All other contants are in automobiles
made at different spots each day of the week. RAFANSLLI then takas the
material to a neeting between him, WILSTED and SECHEN where FA PANELLI
turns the material over to SECHEN and they all discuss the problems and

NOVIKOV during the month of August 1962, it was decided that LIFEAT should
pick up coverage of his replacement Svyatoslav F. KUZNETSOV. The contin-
ued coverage of aleksandr G. SIDOROV, which includes extensive periods of
live-monitoring and special processing of the take, is considered essential to
those Station assets involved in the attempt to place the technical surveillance
noted in last month's report (see reference A). Coverage of the Soviet Bulletin
Office continues to provide interesting personality data on Soviet officials
assigned to Mexico,
(2) LIFEAT/POLISH
LIFEAT coverage in support of the
BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation continues to be vital to that operation. Addi-
tional coverage for this operation has been undertaken, leads from which will
probably determine future direction of the operation as well as aid KUBARK in
controlling the operation.
(3) LIFEAT/YUGOSLAV
In this area LIFEAT provided the infor-
mation that a cousin of a recently assigned KUBARK deep cover agent, Victor
W. OBOLD (ps) will be travelling to Mexico in the near future. This cousin is
a long-time Communist Party official and a chance meeting with him could
have destroyed OBOLD's carefully prepared cover. Due to LIFEAT advanced
warning, proper security safeguards have been arranged, LIFEAT has also
provided travel information on Yugoslav officials from the United States which
was of great interest to ODENVY

(+) LIFEAT/EXILE
LIFEAT coverage in this area has been
most rewarding in providing leads to the contacts of Juan Jose Arevalo Bermejo,
"former Guatemalan President, Spanish Republican Exiles were covered for
approximately one-half month in August, at which time it was decided that the
coverage no longer provided sufficient leads and information to justify con-
tinued LIFEAT effort.
(5) LIFEAT/American Communis: Group in Mexico (ACGM)
This coverage is at the request of the local office of ODENVY and the processing
of take in this area is done by that office. One of the most interesting items
provided from this coverage was the fact that the American Communists Albert
MALTZ and Margaret Larsin MALTZ had separated and that Albert MALTZ
would probably reside in the U.S. with Margaret remaining in Mexico. Con-
cerning the LIFEAT coverage of the ACGM, the local office of ODENVY wrote
on 23 August 1962: "This office feels that the coverage mentioned is quite
valuable and many useful leads are obtained from this coverage, particularly
with regard to travel in and out of Mexico of American Communists who are
in contact with individuals on whom coverage is maintained".

D. Security
During the early part of August 1962 a group of "coyotes" was uncovered
In the telephone company in Mexico City and a number of arrests were made.
This group had organized a unit including linemen, centralmen, installation
crew, warehousemen, and workers in the office responsible for providing ser-
vice to new clients. It was the purpose of the "coyote" group to provide service,
for a price, to those individuals whose requests for installations had been turned
down by the telephone company due to limited availability of cables and contacts,
(Note: The company generally keeps a certain number of "spare pairs" in each
cable for its own use in providing special service, company phones, and for re-
routing during repairs to other cables. It was these spare pairs and contacts
