HOARE stated he going London about 12 March to
check on Yemen deal. HOARE had previously received
letter from Alastair WICKS in London offering him
job with good pay and conditions. He believes this
job concerns Yemen.
Attached a letter from WICKS to HOARE, indicating WICKS
unable to develop proposition further. HOARE estimates
that the WICKS proposition relates to recruitment of mer-
cenaries for service in Yemen. His only basis for this is develop..
ment reported in AZPA 2200.

We are still held up in one business and 14 Thave had to call
in my own supplies to give an estimate as the previous one,
who was virtually unknown to me, did sot seem to understand
the importance of security in the industrial field today. This
In fact should suit us better as lam sure I can do a bet
a better
deal for us with our own man.
I have had to put off my departure for one week as a result
of this as it was important tant to kee keep my fingers on the pulse at
this moment. I have a meeting with the partners tomorrow when
I hope to get things moving and a firm proposal sent to bankers.
"I mentioned to the partners that you had some novel ideas
to solve the delivery problem and in view of the possible extra
cost, they have asked me to get an outline from you as to what
your ideas are, both froin the point of view of additional expense
which, if adopted, would need to be included in the budget and also
to give some added encouragement since this particular problem
comes up again and again and so far I have refused to be drawn
on the subject though you know my first ideas, I think a letter
to the Club Nautico will reach me safely though it would obviously
be inadvisable to mention the Spice Islands.
I hear there is much afoot in your part of the world and both
Brazzaville and the Sudan have been montioned also another
operation. I hope you will not return to that sort of thing - at
least until we have fully explored the possibilities of the new
company.
