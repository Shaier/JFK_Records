HEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
EUEJECT : Tosts of Modified Sights for 7.62 Polgium (FAL) Riflo
REFERENCE: Memo for Red. dated 23 Lay 64, Eubject FAL Silencers/
Sights, from C/ME/SA/צק/מכ
1. On 2 June 1964, Mr. Donald R. Dunn, TSD/EB and the
undersigned went to Isolation to test a modified sight and a
telescopic sight developed for the 7.62 Belgium (FAL) Rifle in
answer to reforence a). The tests were perforaod with the assistance
of Er. James Earb and Mr. Glen Winstead, Isolation.
2. The first tests wore conducted with a Williams Paep sight
nodified to fit an aluminum block which was mounted in place of the
standard FAL rear sight. The Williams sight has a larger diameter
poop than the FAL sight and has a wider rango of elovation settings
as well as mora positive control over both olevation and windage.
The main purpose of the test was to establish a point of roferonce
on the aluminum block to watch the graduations on the Williams
sight and allow the sight to be sot visually for the desired range
onco the weapon was zeroad,
3. Firing commenced from 100 yards at a silhouette target
using the hood of a jeep as a rost. Eoth underloaded and full load
rounds were used. Light rain which gradually increased in intensity
during the day served to complicate the procedure. The test
results at ranges from 25 yds. to 130 yds, using the Williams
sight are summarized in Attachment I. Exceedingly erratic results
vere obtained throughout the tests and one attempt to duplicate
the 100 yd. zoro resulted in a different setting later in the day.
4. 1. 2X scope of Japanese manufacture equipped with aluminum
mounting rings front and reer to fit the reer gas port and roar
sight mount respectively then tested. The scope was attached to
the rifle with difficulty and attempts to zero it wore frustrated
by the inability to dotermine where the rifle was shooting. The
counting moved while attempti: to adjust the olovation knob and it
vas determined that the mount could not be attached firmly enough
to insure in retaining a proper zero, The test with the scope
vas aborted.

5. It is recomended that the scope and count bo discarded
as unfeasible. The Williams sight is acceptablo although the
number of clicks por rovolution of the knob should be reduced.
Further testing of the underloaded azzurition should be con-
ducted to determine the reasons for the erratic porformance.

Raise sight 230 clicks (1 trial)
Katch rof. line to 12.5 line from top
Could not mount telescopic sight properly. Began process of
shooting in scope, found it moved.
At. 100 yds., full loads
Raise sight 4 clicks from bottom
At 150 yds., full loads
Raise sight 8 clicks from bottom.
Intermittant vain throughout tests.
2. Cases with reduced loads vero noted to be blackened at nect
after firing. Suspected to be low pressures not causing
sufficient case expansion to obtain proper scal. This can
contribute to erratic performance. Recommend gas port be turned
to off position to prevent action from opening and allowing
gas leak. Also investigate soft annealing case necks.
