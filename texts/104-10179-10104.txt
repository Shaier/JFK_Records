SUBJECT: Cira TZ, sia: "Cirita", vuas closely connected το
Kamuel RAY.
SOURCE: Karta DIEZ Rivas, Harrici to Dr. Ricardo KACHIN. L'as connect
in Havana with verious anti-Communist organizations..
On a visit I made to source, she told me that she had met Krs.
Cira MARTINEZ in Havens. That Irs. MARTINEZ used the clandestine
pacudonym "Josefina" and was married to architect Frank MARTINEZ,
That both subject and her husband were persons in the absolute
confidence of engineer Manuel RAY, and "Josofina" had been RAY's
secretary for a long time.
007.101
Source claims to have learned from "Josefina" that she was
dissatisfied with RAY's political actions, to the extent that RAY
wanted her to join the executive of the organization J.U.R.E. but she
had rofused because she did not agree with the/ of this
organization. That "Josefina" had described this organization as
a political movement the same as Castroism, only changing the name
of the leader. That tho knows the plan of this organization is to
organizo all anti-BATICTA and anti-CASTRO organizations, undor tho
direction of the J.U.R.E., and develop a nationalistic and copecially
an anti-American policy in order to be able to group all the elements
existing in Cuba that have not figured prominently in the CASTRO
regime. After the fall of the CASTRO rogine they plan to form a,
strong political party in Ouba and capitalize on the mistakos committed
by the provisional Covernment. With this objective in mind, they will
stay separated from the C.R.O. and from all relations with the U.S.
Government in order to be able to carry out their plan freely.
Mrs. Oira MARTINEZ lives with her husband at 1004 NE 17th St.,
Miami, phone umbor PL-C-0483 on which they talk to many persons
related with PAY's plan.
NOTE: One of RAY's most trusted leaders in Miami is still Osorio
DAVILA, former treacuror of the 26th of July Movement and man in the
absoluto confidence of Haydos SANTECIA, For a long time DAVILA was
the Chief of the Havena Immigration Department, until he came to the
U.S. by boat from the coast of Kansas. Some days ago I cubmitted a
detailed report on Ocorio DAVILA, and also on Cremos and many other

own leaders of J.U.R.., because there is another group of
individuals whose nomes are not advertised but who have command powers
in the J.U.R.E. One of these men is Ignacio former leader of
the 25th of July Kovement, private secretary of the Commissioner of
Havana Jose LLALUSA, and G-2 delegate in Havana City Hall. LO
persecuted many persons in the City Hall because he was the one who
made the licts of persons who should be watched, to the G-2. He also
had close connections with the Kinister of the Interior, Jose A.
NARANJO, whom he kept informed about the persons under cuspicion who
worked in the Ministry of the Interior. One time LEDON visited KARANJO
and informed hin, in the presence of KARANJO's secretary, Lucy
ICHEVERRIA, that he should keep Captain Samon PADILLA, at that time
Chief of the Isle of Pines prison, under surveillance. In 1960 PADILLA
was preparing the escape of Captain Jorge Sorus, and thanks to Lucy'в
werning PADILLA took precautions and the plan could be carried out.
Ignacio LIDON lives in liami but I don't know his home address.
Although he inter declared himself ca cati-comunist, and I think he
sought asylum in the Brasilien Embassy, I have no trust in him at all.

On Sunday, October 28, I met twice with Manolo RAY of the Movimiento
Revolucionario del Pueblo (MRP) at the San Juan Intercontinental Hotel, in
San Juan, Puerto Rico. My main objectives weres (1) to elicit from
a a
list of Cubans, presently associated with the Castro regime, who are
critical of Castro and might be considered potential defectors; (2) to
Amin a list of Jubans, either inside or outside the island, who could be
available, in case of an emergency, to help in setting up some kind of
provisional government; and (3) to have his general views on the possibility
of an insurrectionary movement.
Since I had arranged to return to Washington on the same day, I did
not give Ray much Line to do a thorough job. However, he was able to
furnish se with a list of names, covering points (1) and (2). He promised
to provide me with additional information after checking with some of his
associated in New York and Miami. His thoughts on the possibility of an
insurrectionary movement idll be the subject of a separate semorandum.

the Cuban Government. I add my own comments in parenthesis, based on
my conversations with Ray.
