And then the question is whether or not there is a prohi-
bition on printing in the English language.

Mr. Bader. And as I heard the consensus this morning,

we would not move to that recommendation for a prohibition.

law, though I took it it was to be by law, though I can be

I don't think we addressed that this morning.
Mr. Chairman, on these that we considered
that we have a fairly light record on or that

12
we are not too sure what the future holds, one of the members
that I rode over with on the car suggested that perhaps in those
instances we could recommend fairly strongly whatever we want

15
the followon people to do to ensure that the recommendation
does not create havoc within the Agency or does not leave the
rights of citizens unprotected.
16

But that is not a cop out. It is something that you
frequently do, say, let us reserve this for the permanent
oversight committee or for whatever other group. We may have
all the information we need.
19
Senator Huddleston.
Let them make the determination whether
20
or not it should be a statute.
21
Mr.Kirbow. Determine whether in the law whether it is

working all right under the set of regulations.

Mr. Bader. Mr. Chairman, may I say in this instance in

the publishing trade there is no lack of record? The evidence

Senator Huddleston. I call the Committee to order.
Mr. Aaron. I believe Bill Bader had the temerity to
summarize where we stand.
Mr. Bader. Mr. Chairman, where I think we are at the
6
moment is taking the three major issues before the Subcommittee

in the order they were presented, and discussed this morning,
the first being the academic issue, and as I heard the Subcom-
mittee this morning, then I will have another go at the

13
options, give enough options in the option paper and bring it
back before the Committee for a further look before we go on.
Senator Huddleston. By Friday.
Mr. Bader. By Friday, without question.
14
I think by this time we will all have -- we will try to
15

include a positive option, that is to say,to approve if not.
applaud the expanded efforts of FRD to undertake these activi-
ties, or at least to endorse them.

Now, going to the second was the covert use of books and
publishing houses. We discussed two recommendations:
one which
I believe here the Committee has agreed to, and that is a
prohibition on the distribution or subsidy of any books,
magazines or other publications not attributed to the CIA in-
side the United States.
Senator Huddleston. I think we can all accept that, can't
25
we.

and inquiry into it has been thorough, and I think we know this

well. There is no dispute from the Agency.
3
Senator Huddleston. Well, is the law inconsistent with

the statute on the information service?

Mr. Bader. It is the same thing. I would recommend,
Mr. Chairman, that this would be by law, by statute.
Senator Huddleston. On the publication.
Mr. Bader. On the publication.
Senator Mathias. I would support that.
Senator Huddleston. I think Gary Hart would also, so I
think we will make that recommendation, that this one on the
academics is the one we are not sure of.
Mr. Bader. That's the one we would go forward with, and
now we are moving to I would also reiterate that in our
session the other night, I took it as agreement that the
recommendation by statute the CIA should be prohibited from
making operational use of all educational and cultural
grantees of all U.S. Government sponsored programs, this was the

issue which was raised of government funded programs such as
the Fulbright program.

Senator Huddleston And that's either already a regulation

Mr. Bader. Certain categories.

Mr. Kirbow. That is brand new ground.

Mr. diGenova. The John McCloy exceptions to that rule, they
are the only ones that are protected.
Mr. Aaron. That justifies Charles' view that there are
some similarities between Ford Foundation and Government
sponsored activities.
Mr. Bader. Where our discussion was left before lunch
was on the question of the covert use of U.S. journalists and
media institutions, and as it was laid out, it was indicated
that the CIA's intended internal prohibition on the use of the
media extended to the internal prohibitions on the use, opera-
tional use of individuals, American and foreign, who were
accredited to American media organizations.
As I heard it this morning, what we were discussing and
moving to was to extend that prohibition to cover all American
individuals and media organizations, and that the question then

was whether this would be recommended to be something done in
law or a recommendation, or an insistence, if you will, to the
Agency that it further amend its internal directives, its
50-10, to put all media personnel, American media personnel on
the prohibited list, and that is I think where we were.
Senator Huddleston.
I think that's an accurate statement.
That's where we were.
I had expressed a thought that I thought that it ought to
be expanded to include all, but we should hold off on the
statute business for the time being.

Senator Mathias. My role here seems to be the Devil's
1

advocate.
3
4
Senator Huddleston. Good.
Senator Mathias. There is no question about the writing
5 American press or the value in print domestically. Maybe the
role, any legitimate role that news men could, journalists,
6
7
writers could fulfill is available through the information
8 agencies, USIA and groups of that sort.
9
So does anybody know whether there is any real need
10
for allowing some latitude, which is not covered by situations
11
that can be envisioned under USIA or other programs?
12
13
Mr. Kirbow. Well, Senator, the one that I discussed earlier
that I probably didn't make my point well because no one
14
seemed to have picked it up, is we do, by the words here, if I
15 understand Mr. Bader, prohibit an American citizen living in
16
17
Brussels and working for a local newspaper there from having
anything to do with the CIA.
18
Senator Huddleston. No we don't, do we?
19
You mean by his extension?
20
Mr. Kirbow. Yes, sir.
21
22
Senator Huddleston. But not by
Mr. Kirbow. But wasn't that what you wanted to put in
23
the law, that you didn't know if you wanted
24
Senator Mathias. This is the point I wanted to raise
25
here.

Mr. Kirbow. That kind of relationship is something that
2
we should stay away from because I don't see any harm in it,
3
nor do I think the record demonstrates any harm in it. I don't
4
5
see I don't know how in the world this person doing that
taints the minds of the American reading public, which is
6
apparently what you are trying
you're not trying to protect
7
the newsman. You are trying to protect the reader who doesn't
8
9
know that what he's getting is being spoonfed to him from the
CIA, and I don't know why we would be so concerned about
10
protecting newsmen from working, or prohibiting them from
11 working, because I think they have a right to do that as
12 American citizens, just as they do to work with the Department
13 of Defense or any other agency.
14
Mr. Bader. You would then rescind the Agency's standing
prohibition?
Mr. Kirbow. I just don't think you ever prohibit it in
Mr. diGenova. Are you talking bout an affiliated,
accredited journalist, because that's what the Agency regulation
deals with. It doesn't deal with an American citizen. It

Mr. Kirbow. Well, perhaps I misunderstand the extension
that you, your full recommendation.
Do you want to go beyond where the administration is in
their position?
Mr. Bader. I am recommending to go beyond where the
Administration is at this stage, to extend the operational
prohibition on the part of CIA to use American -- Americans in
the media
Mr. Kirbow. Wherever located.
Mr. Bader. Where they are using them undercover, at this
stage, to the extent that it is a cover proposition.

12
Senator Huddleston.
Even if they are in foreign media?
13
Mr. Bader. Yes, sir.
14
Senator Huddleston. And even though all of their
15
activities are related to foreign; they are not writing for
16
American news services.

Mr. Bader. Alternately, they could be with American

media organizations.

shred of evidence on our record that that is in any way wrong-

future the proper use of an individual that could be essential
to the intelligence collection processes of the CIA, and it
