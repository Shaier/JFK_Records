1. DCHAR vas asked first to bring me up to date on what he and the others
in his group have been doing and he reported that they were not doing rich of
anything except waiting. Waiting, first, for some fumis which they are expertiag
to come primarily from the sale of the 3-5; and, second, waiting for the esta
lishment of sore better communication with their contacts in Cuba.
2. With regard to the aircraft, DCHAR told me on this date that he believes
he does now have a sale for the aircraft and he thinks the sale price will be between
03$50 and US$55 thousand.

3.
DCHAR se 1 that he has communicated with someone Co (he wasn't sure cf
the name) in an attempt to solicit funis fra people in Ciba. OCHAR presente:
this in the light that co was "authorizing" some people in Cuba to go ahead
and solicit funds. In this acnection, OCHAR mentioned that at pre time in the
past Julio LOBO (note: this name has never been mentioned in any previous conversations
with this group) had considered donating 154100 thousand for the air force school
which DCHAR was promoting at that time, but apparently became frightened of the
deal and nothing along this me materialized. DCHAR said that he was hopef that
sonetine he would be able to reestablish contact with 1030. All is references
entirely coincidentai to my sizgestions sie to BMW that I mat try to bring
this group together with Julia 030. Zaving learned of this previous connection,
I want to revive this idea ani proceed with the pien to bring these two together.
4. If and when they are able to scriate sore funds, it is their intention
to go ahead with their plans for the establishment of a propaganda program which
would be initially voice radio. ODCHAR said that he had been trying to persuase
OLEDBIAS and EDCOVE to a more narrow program within the limitations which I had sited
for then in a previous meeting (See UMA-11 -). He said he thinks now that this is
the more realistic approach, Dove holds to the original thinking that they 02
cannot comit themselves to sa initiations. DER informed me that DCOVE requests
another recting with me. He was told that I would be away for a few days but veuid
contact hin as soon as I retum.
5. I then questioned DCER about his mowledge and DBLAS' mowledge of the
presence of Soviet Russians.DER stated that his only information had come
5 to him through Douglas ROOT (ls to the Canadian via DVR referred to frequentiv
in his carlier debriefing SADELLY et al). Root claimed to his to have seen the 05
Soviets in Santiago de Cuba ani DCHAR said that furthermore he had ottained the names
which he passed to Colonel LS in the American Brassy in Serena. When acced if
he thought these were the same Sovith that 13 hei referred to 'n his testirny
in Washington, DCEAR said he felt that they were, although he believed GORIAS
information was obtained independent of als, DCHAR'S, source.
6. Going on in this vein, DCHAR stated that ROOT is one of several people
whom DEAR encouraged to remain in place and to go afing with Raul CASTRO and others
for the purpose of obtaining are specifie formation on Commists and Commist
activities in the armed forces. de said that along this line had been fint-05
