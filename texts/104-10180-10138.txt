1. The Sử supplies and instructions needed to establich two-way SW
correspondence with AMIRE 1 are transmitted herewith. We realize that some a
the instruction forms and supplies which are being transmitied are duplicates
of those sent to the Station in support of other operations. Powever, in order
to facilitate the handling of each operation, the supplies for ench are
furnished as a complete unit. This will preclude the need for berroving from
one agent's supplies to outfit another.

2. ANIRE) will write to the Cuse Officer, using carbon system $39337.
Two unused sheets of carbon #39337 should be itsued to the agent for this
purpose. Fe should be told to store them separately to avoid accidental loss
of his writing systera. His carbon systea is developed by means of tablet
#30607. A supply of the developer material, in quantities sufficient for
training purposes, accompanies this dispatch.

3. According to the Wil operational plan, SW messages written by ANT1
vill be mailed to accommodation addresses in various Latin American countries.
In accordance with that, KURIOT will provide the appropriate (Will Field Stations) 28
with the materials necessary for developing the operationel messages.

4. AMERE l will develop the SW messages he receives by means of pill 99
#58838. Ne should be issued (twenty pills $58838 for that purpose. It is
recommended that the agent be told to hide his developer materials in a safe
place. This should not present much of a problem vecnuse (the pills are s०११
umall. We do not generally recommend that (pills be camouflaged as medicines.199
Even in cases where the SW ingredient(does have a bona fide medicinal usoge,
the concentration represented by the SW pill would usually be in excess of the 99
cormal dosrge, and thus there would be a danger of having an unwitting person
use them by accident-qqIf the Cuse Officer feels that for operational reasons
it is desirable (to camouflage then as medicines) they should only be kept in a
bottle which is clearly marked FOR REAL US ONLY) 99

6. The Al Case Oficer should faatliarize himself with the
accompanying supplies and instructions before any attempt is made to trein and
issue supplies to the agent. Experience has shova that it is advisable to plan
for two or three chort (2 hour) agent training sessions scheduled over e period
of days, rather then to attempt to cran the training into one long session.

7. Special attention should be given to planning the cover correspondence.
It is usually recommended tiet the agent use false use and return address on
his SW messages to the Scetion, thereby dic-associating hinsels) completely

correspondence be fictional, and entails a certain count of skill on the part

that the use of a false postal identity) frequently provides the agent with
considerable psychological recosurance during the course of the operation.
