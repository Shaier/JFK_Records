LUIS ALBERTO CONDOM CAJIGAL, who furnished information
set forth in the letterhead memorandum, also advised that he
worked with CIA in Havana from the beginning of 1960 to
November, 1960, through EMILIO FERNANDEZ, a U.S. citizen.(5)
CONDOM also advised that ALVARO FERNANDEZ FOX, who
was also interviewed in this matter, is the nephew of MARTIN
FOX, former owner of the Tropicana Nightclub in Havana, Cuba.
CONDOM believes that since coming to Miami from Mexico City,
ALVARO FERNANDEZ has become involved in the bolita racket
inasmuch as his uncle is supposed to be a bolita racketeer
in Miami. It is noted that when interviewed, ALVARO FERNANDEZ
stated that he is unemployed and lives from money furnished
him by his uncle, MARTIN FOX, and another uncle, PEDRO FOX, also
residing in Miami at 302 Southwest Beacom Boulevard.'
ALVARO FERNANDEZ, in addition to the information set
forth in the enclosed letterhead memorandum, advised that while
he was in Mexico City he worked as an informant for STEVE MINAS,
U.S. Customs representative, U.S. Embassy, telephone 46-94-00,
Extension 373, or home phone 48-02-50. He also advised that
he was to contact Customs Agent ED FICKIE in Miami at FR 7-3571,
which he did; however, FERNANDEZ has not been used by FICKIE
in the Miami area. FERNANDEZ advised he helped on narcotics
matters.
