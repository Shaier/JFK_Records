Reference is made to the name check request, dated
18 June 1963, subject as above, whose name you desired checked
against the files of this office. The files contain the
following information concerning Subject.

According to a report dated 23 March 1961 from an
official West German service, the Bremer Bank in Bremen
Germany, reported that they had received a check for one
thousand dollars from one Eduardo Espinosa y PRIETO of the
Mexican Embassy in Moscow, USSR, to be deposited to the
account of one Erik SCHOTT, an architect residing at Ginsterweg
1, Bremen Munthe, West Germany.

On the basis of this information, SCHOTT was inter-
rogated by the West German service on 21 November 1961 for possible intelligence involvement. During the interrogation,
SCHOTT provided the following information concerning Subject:
SCHOTT first became acquainted with Subject in 1940 when he
resided in Subject's home in Germany. Subject, who had moved
to Poland, wrote to SCHOTT in 1957 and asked him to buy used
cars and ship them to him. Subject transmitted to SCHOTT
dollars and dollar checks for purchasing the cars via an
unknown Polish sailor. Subject told SCHOTT that he had obtained
the money on the black market and from exhibitors at the Poznan
Fair. SCHOTT believed that Subject obtained the money from
Poles who had relatives in the United States. During a visit
to Belgium in 1957, Subject purchased several second-hand taxis
and cars for shipment to Poland. Subject visited SCHOTT in
late 1957 and purchased a Renault to take back with him to Poland.
For the purpose of avoiding the customs duty on the car, SCHOTT
gave Subject a statement to the effect that he was a relative.

In 1959 SCHOTT visited Subject in Gdansk, Poland. Subject
told SCHOTT that he could obtain dollars from "an employee
of an embassy" which he would send to SCHOTT for desposit
in his account at the Bremer Bank. Subject obtained the
dollars for zlotys at the black market exchange rate. SCHOTT'S
wife, who was also interrogated, stated that checks arrived
by mail from an employee of the Mexican Embassy in Warsaw,
Poland, which her husband deposited in Subject's account.
Among documents obtained officially from the Bremer Bank was a letter from Mexican Ambassador in Warsaw, Eduardo ESPINOSA
y PRIETO accompanying a check for one thousand dollars for
deposit to the account of Erich SCHOTT. Subject told SCHOTT
that in 1950 his maid had reported to the Polish authorities
that he had dollars in his house. As far as SCHOTT knew,
Subject was investigated but was never sentenced. On 24 June
1961, Subject again visited SCHOTT and from Germany went to
Zelzate, Belgium, to settle a debt from automobile buying
operations in 1957. Subject visited his sister in Paris,
France, and returned with her to Bremen in a new Peugot which
he had bought in Holland in his sister's name. Subject then
shipped the car to Poland.

According to the West German service, no evidence
was uncovered that would indicate SCHOTT was Involved in
intelligence activities.
