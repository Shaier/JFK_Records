your employment with the Agency?

A
כיו
3
When I first came in I was in the Intelligence
Directorate for approximately ten years and I was put on special
detail, special indefinite detail, in the Deputy Director, Plans,
5
which is now the Directorate of Operations.
6
What year were you put on that detail?
7
A
I guess it was 1964, January, I believe.
8
Ω
And what did that detail involve?
9
A
Cuban operations, economic warfare.
10
Q
And how long were you on that detail?
11
A
I was in the Cuban operations for nine years.
12
Q
Between 1964 and. 1973?
13
A
(Nods in affirmative.)
14 ||
Q
And in 1973 did you assume your current position?
15
A
Yes, January.
16
Q
Now, while you were on special detail to the DOD?
17
A
Yes.
18
2
Were you stationed in Washington?
19
A
Yes.
20
Q
And did you commute with some frequency to Miami?
21
A
Yes.
22
2
Were your activities in Miami in any way connected
23
with the operations of the Miami Station?
24
A
In some way. My responsibilities were worldwide.
25
I took temporary duty predominantly in Europe, and then Miami.

1
Most of my operations were run out of Europe.
2
Q
Run out of
3
A
Europe. Some were run out of Miami but the big ones
4
were run out of Europe.
5
Q
Well, in the course of your activities with respect
6
7
to Cuba did you have occasion to become familiar with the
operations of the Miami base?
8
A
Yes.
9
Q
And the situation in the Cuban community in Miami?
10
A
Yes, sir.
11
Q
During the nine years you were with DDO's Cuban
12
operations, who was who were the chiefs of the Miami
13
Station?
14:
A
I think in 1963 Ted Shackley was the Chief and he
15
16
was followed by I can't think of his name. I should know
it. Well, I will come back to that.
17
18
Q
Then, the next Chief of Station was Paul Henze.
What years was he Chief?
19
A
I think Paul was there about a year and a half.
He
20.
left in 1968 when we reduced the size of the Station.
Let's
21
say Henze was there from 1966 to 1968.
And then Jake Esterline.
22
He was Chief of Station from 1968 to 1973.
23
Q
Now, what was the formal title of the group to which
24
you were assigned for the 9-year period?
25
A
Well, when I first came in it was known as the

Special Activities Staff. It was headed by Desmond Fitzgerald.
And then, I believe after that it became the Cuban Operations
ان
Group.
4
Q
5
Now, was this a special group within the DDO or was
it attached to one of the area divisions?
6
A
No. Following the Bay of Pigs, they created a thing
7
called Task Force W which was headed by Bill Harvey.
And
8
that
when Harvey left, he went to Chief of Station, Rome,
9
10
and Fitzgerald took over, it became Special Activities Staff.
It wasn't attached to anything except it reported to the
:
11
Deputy Director, Plans.
12
Q
And that was Mr. Karamessines?
13
A
Yes.
Well, it was Helms at that time back when it
14
was first created. Helms was DDP at that time.
15.
Ω And Task Force W was created immediately after the
16
Bay of Pigs?.
17
A
Well, not immediately.
I think sometime around
18:
19
in the Bay of Pigs was in April. I think this was created in
September, something like that, 1961.
20
Q
And that subsequently became the Special Activities
21
Staff?
22:
A
Special Activities Staff and consequently became the
23
Cuban Operations Group. As the Cuban Operations Group it went
24
back into the Western Hemisphere Division.
25
Ω
And what was the date of that reorganization?

A
Well, let's see. I would say that was probably around
1965 because Fitzgerald then became Chief, W.H., and then
later DDP.
Q
Now, Mr.Harvey
do you recall what position Mr.
Harvey held after he left Task Force W?
A
Yes. He was Chief of Station, Rome.
Q
And is he still with the Agency?
A
Oh, no. He retired a long time ago.
Q
Do you know where he lives at the present time?
A
Frankly, I don't. I have an idea where he lives.
He went to work for a friend of mine who had a law firm.
Harvey is a lawyer.
Q
Indianapolis area?
A
Yes, some place around there. It is in the midwest,
Indiana.
Q
What was the role that was assigned to Task Force
W?
A
It was the overall Cuban operations.
2
Did the Miami
when was the Miami Station estab-
lished?
20
A
Well, I think they had a forward operatio-s base down
21
there about 1960 which was small, in Coral Gables.
22

This was, then, prior to the Bay of Pigs?
23
A
Oh, yes.

Now, in addition to Task Force W, was the Miami

Station running any operations against Cuba?
2
A
You mean prior to the Bay of Pigs?
3
Q
Yes.
4
A
I really don't know. It was a small
it was a
forward base and it was more or less as I recall, a support type

thing.
7
::
Q
Well, after the Bay of Pigs when Task Force W was
8
established, did it have sole responsibility for Cuban

:
operations?
1C
A
Yes.
11
Q
Or was that shared with the Miami base, Miami
12
Station?
i
13
A
No. The Miami Station was under Task Force W.
14
Q
All right. Would that also be true of the Special
15 .:
Activities Staff, the Cuban Operations Group?
:
16
A
Right, except that at the present time the Station
:
17
has no Cuban operations.
18
Q
I understand that. When were Cuban operations termi-
19
nated?
20
A
At the Station? Let's see.
Sternfield went down
i
21.
there in 1972. It was during fiscal year '72. I think it was
22
in early 1973. It was a gradual reduction.
23
Q And have those operations been terminated entirely
24
or are they now run out of the Washington area?
25
A
All Cuban operations are run out of Washington.

There are no more paramilitary operations, that type of thing.
Q But there are some Cuban operations being run out of
the Washington area?
A
Right.
Q
Is that correct?
A
Right. Worldwide.
Q
Mr.Sturbitts, in the last couple of weeks you may
have seen some allegations in the press about possible assassina-
tion attempts that have been mounted or alleged assassination
attempts that have been mounted

Q
against Fidel Castro. In the course of your

activities with respect to Cuba, did you ever learn of any such
i.
attempts?
A
16:
Well, let me answer it this way. I wouldn't say
attempts. I know there was discussion. "Attempts" is too
strong a word.
Q
19:
Well, can you place in time your first knowledge of
any such discussions?

I was on TDY and this was October, November, 1963, with Fitzgerald
let me put
in Paris. And I knew that he was going to meet
it another way. I had overheard that discussions were going on

with a member of Castro's military but that he wanted, as
