2.  The following information supplements the material on

referenced above.

    a.  Our representatives in Melbourne advised that Australian

arrived in Sydney, Australia in 26 October 1956, aboard the S. S.

permit, she made so comment concerning same. The Mexican
Government approved her in(it)ial application with the function that she deposit with the
Consulate a 10,000 Peso bond, as a guarantee of her intention to deposit
Mexico upon expiration of her Tourist Card. No communication
indicates certain no record of her actual arrival in Mexico following
approval of her 8 July 1960 application. The most recent correspond-
ence on these case contained in Mexico files is dated 24 February 1961,
reflecting that Anastasie DAMASCO again requested a Tourist Card
on or about the date of the letter, at which time her address in the
United States was given as c/o Mexican Consul, San Antonio, Texas.
In reply to her second application for an entry card, the Mexican consulate
in San Antonio replied with a request that she post a bond in the amount of
10,000 Pesos, to guarantee departure from Mexico upon expiration of
her tourist visa. There is no further information currently available
on her further travel plans.

    c.  With reference to Nicolas Georges DAMASCOU, on basis
of the information reported in preceding paragraphs, a recheck by our
representatives with officials of the United States Embassy in Mexico
City indicated that Nicolas Georges DAMASCO, born 18 March 1931
at Alexandria, Egypt, holder of Greek Passport 1961 issued in
Alexandria, Egypt, on 8 March 1961 and valid to 10 April 1964, with
address of 4 Elizabeth King Road, Elizabeth Bay, Sydney, Australia,
was the recipient of a United States Visa on 20 October 1960. On his
application, DAMASCOU indicated that he desired to visit the United
States for a period of four months, described as a pleasure trip to visit
his sister. The visa application did not include any destination address
in the United States. It was also noted that the visa card maintained on
Nicolas DAMASCOU in the Embassy in Mexico City contains a notation
“10689 to Immigration and Naturalization Service, Los Angeles,
May 29 1961.”

    d.  Through a reliable confidential source, our representa-
tives in Egypt had learned in the interim that Nicolas DAMASCOU, who
is identical with the individual described in preceding paragraphs,
currently resides in Los Angeles, California, at 1100 North Gardner,
Apartment 14, and that he advised his mother and younger brother,
still residing in Alexandria, that he plans to marry the daughter of an
American official, who is not further identified. The same source
also advised that Georges DAMASCOU aka DAMASCUS, father of
Nicolas and Anastasie DAMASCOU aka DAMASCUS, died during the
summer of 1960. Following the demise of the father, Angelika

DAMASCOU, in company of a younger son not identified by name, had
planned to migrate from Egypt to join her son Nicolas in the United
States. However, prior to the finalization of these plans, Angelika
DAMASCOU suffered a stroke, details concerning which are not
known, but she is reported as of this writing still to be partially para-
lyzed and obviously unable to travel. No further information was available on
the possible future migration plans of Angelika DAMASCOU nee
SAVOURAS and/or of her unidentified younger brother of Nicolas
DAMASCOU and of Anastasia DAMASCOU.

    e.  On basis of the reported filing of an application for a
United States Visa in July 1956 at the U.S. Embassy in London by
Anastasia DAMASCOU, our representatives in London were requested
to institute checks of their indices in the names of Nicolas
DAMASCOU and of Angelika DAMASCO. M. I.5 advised that as of
late July 1961, they held no traces on Nicolas Georges DAMASCOU aka
DAMASIOU aka DALLAS aka DAMASCO, but that although they had
no traces on Anastasia DAMASCOU, they were continuing to check her
possible residence in London during 1956, based on the reported visa
application data. M.I.5 advised that they hold no traces on either
Nicolas Georges DAMASCO aka DAMASIOU aka DAMASCUS or on
his father Aristotela Georges DAMASCOU.

3.  It is suggested that the indices of the Department of State,
Visa Division as well as the indices of the Immigration and Naturaliza-
tion Service, Department of Justice, may contain further detailed
information on the current immigration status, whereabouts in the
United States, and also the contacts in the United States of Nicolas
Georges DAMASCO aka DALLASCUS or of Anastasio Georges DAMASCOU
aka DAMASCUS, and any other members of the family who may have
applied for entry visas from abroad.

4.  With regard to Justus BLERRA Casariego, mentioned in above
referenced memorandum of 17 July 1961, a contact of Nicolas
DAMASCOU aka DAMASCUS, it is suggested that the indices of the
Department of State may contain additional information on his activities
during his service at the Mexican Embassy in Washington, D.C.
