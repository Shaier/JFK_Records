1978 VISIT OF PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER.
ALTHOUGH THERE IS
A TENDENCY TO BLAME THE UNITED STATES FOR VENEZUELA'S CURRENT
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS, IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH
MIGHT TAKE PLACE WOULD BE AIMED AT PRESIDENT CARTER, BUT
RATHER THEY WOULD BE STAGED DURING THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT
TO EITHER EMBARRASS THE CURRENT VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT OR TO
FURTHER DRAMATIZE THE CAUSE BEING ADVOCATED. (SOURCE: A
STAFF OFFICER OF THIS AGENCY.)
3. THE VENEZUELAN SECURITY SERVICES RECOGNIZE THIS
SITUATION AND EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE UNPLEASANT, ANTI-
VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT INCIDENTS DURING PRESIDENT CARTER'S
CARACAS VISIT. VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THESE INCIDENTS
WILL DEAL WITH CHARGES OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND GOVERNMENT
CORRUPTION. THE SECURITY FORCES WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL ANY
SITUATION THAT ARISES, THE AUTHORITIES BELIEVE. (SOURCE:

KNOWN AS THE ANTONIO JOSE DE SCURE GUERRILLA FRONT: THE
ARMED FORCES OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (FALN), AND THE ORGANIZATION
OF REVOLUTIONARIES (OR). THESE GROUPS HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN
THE EASTERN VENEZUELAN STATES, PARTICULARLY MONAGAS, ANZOATEGUI,
SUCRE AND BOLIVAR. THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT NUMEROUS
RAIDS ON MILITARY POSTS, HAVE TAKEN OVER SMALL TOWNS FOR A LIMITED
PERIOD OF TIME DURING WHICH THEY LECTURED THE TOWNS PEOPLE ON
ANTI-GOVERNMENT POLITICAL THEMES, AND IN GENERAL HAVE HARRASSED
AND EMBARRASSED THE GOVERNMENT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. (SOURCE:

THEY MOVE ABOUT THE TOWNS AND CITIES OF
THE AREA RELATIVELY FREELY AND GENERALLY ENJOY THE SUPPORT

THE AREA, OR THROUGH THE YEARS HAVE SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME
THERE, HAVE MUCH IN COMMON WITH THE LOCAL PEOPLE, AND, IN SHORT,
ARE MORE FRIENDLY AND THUS MORE WELCOME THAN THE GOVERNMENT

THE GOVERNMENT OVERNMENT'S OWN HEAVY HANDED METHODS IN DEALING
WITH THE LOCAL POPULATION, HAVE, IN TURN, HARMED THE GOVERN-
MENT'S IMAGE IN THE AREA FAR MORE THAN THE GUERRILLAS COULD
HAVE HOPED TO DO WITH THEIR OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT
PUBLICLY CLAIMS TO HAVE CAPTURED SEVERAL GUERRILLA LEADERS
RECENTLY, THE PRISONERS ARE ILLITERATE FARM WORKERS WHO CLEARLY
ARE NOT TRAINED GUERRILLA FIGHTERS. THOSE WHO FEEL THAT THEY HAVE
BEEN VICTIMIZED BY THE SECURITY FORCES, TURN AWAY FROM THE

VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES HADBELIEVED THAT
AFTER SPENDING AN ENJOYABLE HOLIDAY SEASON, THE GUERRILLAS WOULD

II. CUBAN EXILES
13. THE CUBAN EXILE COMMUNITY IS LARGE, WELL-ESTABLISHED
AND INFLUENTIAL。 FURTHERMORE, IT CURRENTLY FEELS BETRAYED AND
REJECTED BY BOTH THE USG AND THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT. IN
THE FORMER CASE, THE CUBAN EXILE COMMUNITY IS CONCERNED BY THE
USG'S EXPANDED FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT.
WITH REGARD TO THE GOV, THE EXILES HAVE COME TO DISTRUST
THE PEREZ ADMINISTRATION WHICH THEY FEEL HAS UNJUSTLY
HARRASSED THE COMMUNITY SINCE THE 6 OCOBER 1976
BOMBING OF A CUBANA AIRLINE, SUPPOSEDLY BY CUBAN EXILE EXTREMISTS.

VENEZUELAN CITIZENSHIP OF A WELL-KNOWN CUBAN PHYSICIAN IN RETALIATION

PEREZ. BOSCH HIMSELF HAS SAID THAT PRESIDENT PEREZ WILL BE HELD
PERSONALLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIS DEATH.

SECURITY SERVICES.
AMONG THESE ARE ORLANDO O GARCIA,
DISIP'S CHIEF OF OPERATIONS, AND RICARDO MORALES, A
FORMER DISIP SECTION CHIEF AND A CLOSE ASSOCIATE OF GARCIA.
MORALES HAS IN THE PAST INDICATED HIS BELIEF THAT THE USG
IS IN SOME MEASURE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS CURRENT PROBLEMS AND
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS HAS MADE THREATENING REMARKS TOWARD USG
PERSONNEL IN VENEZUELA. WHILE MORALES NO LONGER HOLDS AN
OFFICIAL POSITION IN DISIP, HE DOES MAINTAIN SOME DISIP
CONNECTIONS. MORALES TRAVELS ABROAD FREQUENTLY AND IS
CURRENTLY BELIEVED TO BE OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY.

THẤT MORALES RECENTLY THREATENED THE LIFE OF DIEGO
RRIA, VENEZUELA
MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND TOURISM,
WHILE ARRIA WAS TRAVELLING ABROAD. THE COMMUNITY HAS IN THE
PAST SUSPECTED MORALES TO BE AN AGENT OF THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT.
SINCE THEY FEEL THAT ARRIA IS A RATHER UNLIKELY TARGET FOR CUBAN
EXTREMISTS, THE COMMUNITY BELIEVES THAT MORALES THREAT, IF
INDEED MADE, IS POSSIBLY A CUBAN GOVERNMENT ATTEMPT TO FURTHER
DISCREDIT THE EXILE COMMUNITY IN VENEZUELA.

IV. THE VENEZUELAN SECURITY SERVICES
SECRET
21. THE VENEZUELAN SECURITY SERVICES, ESPECIALLY DISIP,
HAVE BEEN HARD HIT BY PERSONAL RIVALRIES AMONG THEIR TOP
OFFICIALS. PART OF DISIP'S DIFFICULTIES ARISE FROM CHARGES
OF MISCONDUCT IN THE HANDLING OF THE ANTI-GUERRILLA CAMPAIGN
IN THE EASTERN STATES. ANOTHER PART STEMS FROM MUTUAL DISTRUST
AND BACKBITING AMONG ITS LEADERS. DISIP'S EFFICIENCY, WHICH UNDER
NORMAL CONDITIONS IS NONE TOO GOOD, IS NOT UP TO ITS USUAL
STANDARD. DISIP DIRECTOR GIMENEZ HAS VOICED HIS LACK OF
FAITH IN THE YOUNGER GENERATION OF DISIP OFFICERS AND HAS
EXPRESSED HIS DESIRE FOR A RETURN TO THE OLDER, MORE EXPERIENCED
OFFICIALS. (SOURCE: CA VENEZUELAN PROFESSIONAL MAN 7 WITH CONTACTS
AMONG VENEZUELAN SECURITY OFFICIALS AND WHOSE REPORTING IS (S)

PROBLEMS WHICH, ACCOKING TO DISIP DIRECTOR GIMENEZ, ARE DUE TO
THE GOV'S CURRENT BUDGET PROBLEMS COUPLED WITH POOR ADMINISTRATION
DURING JANUARY AND FEBRUARY BOTH AGENCIES WERE FORCED TO BORROW
FROM FEDERAL BANKING INSTITUTIONS TO MEET THEIR PAYROLLS. EVEN
SO, PAYROLL DISBURSEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE LATE. AS A RESULT,
MORALE AMONG THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THESE AGENCIES IS LOWER
THAN USUAL.

25. IN GENERAL, THE INTERNAL DIFFICULTIES OF THE
SERVICES TEND TO MAKE BOTH DIM AND DISIP LESS FORTHCOMING
WITH AND TRUSTFUL OF OUTSIDERS. FURTHERMORE, THEY ARE
SUSPICIOUS OF EACH OTHER AND MUTUAL COOPERATION IS LIMITED.
DESPITE THESE LIMITATIONS, THE VENEZUELAN SECURITY SERVICES
ARE WELL DISPOSED TO AND CAN BE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE THE

CARTER AND HIS PARTY.
