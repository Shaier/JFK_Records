1. Station passed referenced information to custos
on 13 September 1975. Initial checks by the Station witle
the FLI, DEA, and Custoas revealed no information on the
Individuals sentioned in reference (Donald enry,
Jolin Brooks and oboroy). Customs was
in agreement with the Station's suggestion that a Custons
telephone number should be passed to Henry and the case
shoull be piat into Customs hunds.
2. Henry called Custos on 13-September 1975. Anecting

Drools as possibly being one of his contacts. lienry was
thus net by two Customs officers. On returning, from their
Meeting, the Customs officers notified the Station, and a
meeting was arranged to see them on t Geptember 1973.
Customs provided the following information on Donald ilenry.
a. Donald Henry is about 52 years old. He is from
Michigan. lle lived and went to school in Canada. ile moved
to Florida about fifteen years ago. He has resided in the
Keys for about seven years.
b. Henry was described by Customs as a braggart.

Lustos stated that Deary always had a quick answer for any
question asked of hir, but when the questions got down to
specifics his answers were vague.

ALD was aware of the operation and condoned it. Customs
noted that leary did not pick up the name Dolo ог brown
until after they had mentioned a Special Forces major, at waich
point weary professed to remember his name.
enenry also told Customs, when wa as..ed why he had
called RALD, that he had telephoned the FI first and
was told by then that nis information was not in their juris-
diction and was given the phone number for AL. Later,
Venry chanced his story to the effect that he said he looked
in the Ciri telepizone directory to get the FBI's number and
called ERALD (CDI) instead because the latter's number
was under the FRI'S. (Comment. Hot true, both aunbers are
listed under J.S. Goverment but on separate pages.)

Underwater Sports of America, Ciami, Florida, as a salesman
in the early 1960's. At the time, reported Custons, Under-
water Sports was engaged in contractual word for BALD
concerning training during preparations for the bay of Pigs.
The last contact Customs had with Wilbur was about three weeks
ago. They plan to see him again in the next few days and
will attempt to get his side of the story.
7. Customs stated that in spite of the inconsistencies
in Henry's story they felt he was nakin, a legitimate offer
to assist and thus advised him to proceed along the following
lines:
a. Re-contact Albur and tell him that he was
prepared to fly arms to Abaco, but he would have to see the
front, money" first. Customs commented that if Wilbur
produces the monoy, they would have a caser if not, the whole
opisodo could probably be chalked up to Wilbur 'sdelusions.
b. After re-contacting Wilbur and if Wilbur comes up
with the money, Henry should attempt to convince ..im of the
necessity of a dry run. If a dry run is not possible, then
he is to go ahead with the operation. Arrests would be made
by Customs in the States after the arzs have been placed in
the aircraft and after the personnel involved have boarded
the plane.
3.
Customs has promised to keep the Station apprised of
the case, especially as it pertains to the Bahamas and other
areas in the Caribbean.

were shipped to the States for display
in military museums.
Not surprisingly, WerBell has often
been called an operative of the
Central Intelligence Agency, a charge
that angers lum only when it is lev.
eled too vehemently. It is not that
he has anything against the CIA. He
just doesn't, he says, happen to be
one of its boys. His paramilitary work,
whch consists of advising and some-
tapes directly assisting foreign gov.
ern-nents, is done in the employ of
what he calls an independent group
of well-intentioned, patriotic Ameri
cans." The Birch Society? The Min-
utemen? A bunch of far-right Texач
millionaires Werbell won't say, other
than to lasiat that it is not the CIA.
It hardly matters, for according to
WerBell, it is all in the service not only
of freedom and anti communism but
of the US. government; he does not
supply or advise or fight for regimes
not bearing the State Department seal
of approval. A heavy percentage of his
merchandise goes directly to the U.S.
government, which distribates it to its
own: forces that need silent or exotic,
weapons. The balance is sold to
friendly governments, either directly
or through the good offices of the "in-
dependent group." He says he does not
sell to individuals, not even if they're
certified anticommunists.
WerBeil takes pains to point out that
he is no ordinary arins broket. That is,
he is not one of those shadowy figures
who sell weaporis to both sides at exor-
bitant prices or who take possession of
contraband shipments on the high seas.
"We've always adhered to a basic pol
wey: There is only one friend of the
United States in a given area, and we
deal only with that.friend."
What does WerBell peddle? A range

desk-sized cannons, from the meanest-
looking weapons to innocent looking
swagger sticks that fire a bullet or
even a small rocket; an array of tech.

that will help an American soldier or a
foreign army hold off irisurgent forces,
and occasionally, his personal services.
These services present WerBell at
his most shadowy. Serving as a com-
batant in the armed forces of a foreign
nation is against U.S. law, and WerBell
is understandably reluctant to admit
having done so. He describes himself
in such terins as "paramilitary" and
"adviser," but acquaintances suspect
he has been in the thick of the fighting
a number of times. He may even have
zapped an insurgent or two.

The bulk of WerBell's business is In

used on large as well as small weap-
ons, and in fact have been used effec-
tively on the wicked-looking Vulcan
machine guns mounted on American
helicopters in Vietnam. The Australian

Sionics suppressor "superior to any-
thing previously used... (with it) it is
now possible for the sniper to fire
from relatively short ranges, especially
when using subsonic projectiles."
WerBell is so enthusiastic about the
Ingram Model submachine guns (there
are two models, taking different sized
errtridges) that he predicts they will
eventually make "obsolete every indi-
vidual weapon in the world." The U.S.
Army, he says, is now looking care-
fully at the Ingram models with an eye
toward making them standard equip.

dedicated to killing people. Environ-
mental Industries, WerBell says, is
bankrolled by some of the East's most
prominent investment houses; he is its
director of International operations.
He is also president of a subsidiary
called Military Armaments Co., Inc.,
and because he is in Powder Springs,
Military Armaments is there, too. (B
hind Environmental Industries, Wer-
Bell says, is "a third shadow of which
E.l. is a subsidiary"-another tantaliz-
Ing hint of the CIA.)
Military Armaments may well be a
unique American enterprise. Nobody
else, WerBelt says, is in the business
of designing special purpose weapons
on such a scale. A good deal of its de-
signing and manufacturing is done
under federal license. Silencers, for ex-
ample, are outlawed by the National
Firearms Act, along with sawed-off
shotguns, submachine guns and other
vestiges of PProhibition era gangiand
wars,
To manufacture his suppressors,
WerBell must pay a special tax of $500
a year, collected by the Treasury
Department. The T-men also check pe
riodically to see that his awesome
collection of firearms over 200 indi-
vidual pieces-is properly registered.
Apparently the market for suppressors
is not very large because, according to
WerBell, is firm is the only one au-
thorized to manufacture them.
WerBell will not discuss the sales or
profits of Military Armaments except
to say that, after two years of exten-
sive research and development (result-
ing in "a taxloss of a half million dol
lars"), the company is now doing very
well. It has about 12 employees, includ.
ing four machinists who work under
the direction of Gordon Ingram, who
has charge of the design operation and
whose name is on the Model 11 subma-
chine gun that young Mitch demon-
atrated on the firing range.
Cottage Industry'
INGRAM
INGRAM WORKS in a well-equipped
machine shop-lab attached to the
main house on the estate, which Wer-
Beh likes to call "the farm." WerBell's
office is next door to the shop. Its walis
are so loaded with weapons that it' is a
wonder they do not collapse. There are
knives and spear guns and pistols and
rifles and machine guns, dozens and
dozens of them, some purchased, some
won in combat, some, presented by the
appreciative recipients of WerBell's
counterinsurgency techniques.
WerBell, who has a sense of humor,
calls his enterprise a "cottage indus-
try" and likens himself to "a country
doctor... I can fall out of the living
arca upstairs right down to the office."
Upstairs is the domain of his German-
born wife Hildegard, a pleasant,
gray-haired woman who has borne
weapons for the U.S. Army and other counterinsur.
WerBell six children and put up with
his rather unusual way of life. (When
he left for the Far East in 1968, he sald
he'd be gone for a year or more, and
he was.)
A Military Profile
M
ITCHELL WERBELL is a short,
wiry man of 52, quick with a
quip and quite sensible until he begins
talking about communism or other so-
cial Issues. He has the face and bear:
Ing of a Prussian officer, an image he
cultivated by wearing a mustache and
occasionally a morocle. He often
dresses in military clothing of indeter
minate origin, and he embellishes the
image by talking in slightly clipped
sentences peppered with military
phrases. There is nothing phony in
this. WerBell has a strong attachment
to weapons and to warfare, and he has
been around them so long that the
Ideas arid styles they foster are an in.
grained part of his personality.
He comes by both his militarism and
his anticommunism honestly. His
father was an officer in the Russian
Imperial army, even though he was
born in the United States. "It was a
tricky situation," says Mitch: "He was
a citizen of both the U.S. and Russia.
In those days you could do that."
The elder Werßell fought against
the Bolsheviks, but before the collapse
of the czarist regime he wisely secured
an appointment as liaison officer be
tween the Russian and American
forces stationed in the U.S. He livedy
in this country for the rest of his life,
putting his early medical training to
use in cancer research.
A legacy from father is Mitch's
barely disguised aristocratic sympa
thies. He has been quoted as saying
"Communism is a substitution of a
peasant dictatorship over the aristocra
cy-l prefer the aristoctacy." He is
without question an elitist.. Not surpris
Ingly, his elite is composed of superpa
triots and military men.
Mitchell WerBell was born in. Penn
sylvania, shortly after his Russian
American father and his Scottish-born
mother arrived in the U.S. at the end
of Word War 1. His parents traveled as
good deal, here and abroad, and Mitch
traveled with them, picking up his edus
cation as he went. He got a degree in
WerBell recovered from a leg injury.
vertising in a department store. Soon
he was head of the department, and
soon after that he went on his own.
In the mid-'50s, WerBell pulled out
of his agency and then formed his
own publle relations firm. "I'd already
been drifting into international PR;"
WerBell says, "using my family back-
ground. I had tremendous contacts in
Europe, and I moved into the Far
East, too." How much of this moving
in was military, WerBell won't say,
but his business took on more and
more of what he calls a "geopoliitcal"
flavor.
Before long, he was dabbling in
Latin. American dictatorships. "Before
Fidel took over in Cuba, we were
working closely with Batista." He adds.
with a grin, "Our function was to keep
Batista in power, although the U.S..
government was looking favorably on
Fidel at that point."
From all this, even WerBell doesn't
know exactly how, came a passionate
concern about communism. "I decided
to devote whatever time I could to
anticommunist activities," he says.
"At first it was sort of a hobby, but
then it became my main drive life.
what I'm doing nowhere he es
tures at the arsenal on his office walls
-"affords me a damned good living.
But the living is not why I do it."
The Heart of It
IN 1948, WIIILE anticommunism was
still a hobby, albeit a paying hobby,
WerBell purchased the Dobbs estate..
He installed rudimentary design facili
ties and began experimenting with
weapons of counterinsurgency, weap-
ons he believed had the best chance of
prevening Commanist takeovers in
the small, underdeveloped nations of
Asia and Latin America. "I realized
that in counterinsurgency, the pri
mary problem was a lack of depth. in
weaponry. People say, 'Win the hearts
of the enemy, and you'll win the fight.'
That's a lot of bull. The best way to
get their hearts, if they're the enemy,
is to shoot 'em and cut the hearts
out."
While he experimented with weap
ons-quietly, to avoid problems with
the federals-WerBell proceeded with
his personal brand of geopolitics. He
made himself available to anticommu-
Journalisın from the University ofnist regimes that wanted help in fight-
Pennsylvania. In World War II, he
joined the OSS, and served with a unit
behind Japanese lines in China, rising
to the rank of captain and acquiring a
taste for guerrilla-type warfarehe
would never lose.
WerBell moved to Atlanta shortly
after the war and went to work in ad
ing off one band of Insurgents or an-
other. In the process, he became
friendly with a number of Latin Amer-
tea's political strongmen, They were
delighted to discover a Nore Ameri
cano who felt as they did about the
need for stable, anticominunist. re
gimes, especially their regimes,.and.
who had both the savvy and the guts
to help preserve them.
