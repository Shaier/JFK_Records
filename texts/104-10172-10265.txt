TEPLYANOWA did not in fact weet COLLASMA as
previously stated but only knew of her and GOLITSYN
from her parents.
2. Source is quite clear about GOLUSER's instructions
and had not confused the names of GODITS and KOSKO.
COLUBOV had been sent a directive from Loscow setting
out his wain tasks. This was couched in somewhat rough,
direct words in order to put him on the right lines.
Source did not deduce from what was in this directive
that the K.C.3. believed that either man was living in
England. It certainly stated that NOSEIKO had visited
England after his defection and that GORIOS had
visited England several times. Source rows only what
GOLUBEV told him and what was in the directive; he has
no idea why the K.0.5. believed that either of the two
defectors had visited the U.K.

this could not be, since Mrs. COLISYX defected with

Para、3-b: The wording of this paragraph is almost identical
ference
to nuch of paragraph 3-b of Source's report on Yuriy
Ivanovich NOS:40, regarding COLUE's instructions,
belief that both defectors had visited England,
LC afteopts to locate then, ete、 The unlu
as given in these reports is that NOXO is said to
Dave been in the US in 1965, and COLITSYS "several
times".
Since NOSESSO did not visit the US in 1965
bat we understand that GOLITSY: did male several visits,
wondor (in view of the strong similarities in wording)
if there may be a garble in Source's reporting. Does
Source have any idea as to why the KG: believed either
of the two defectors Lad visited the US?
