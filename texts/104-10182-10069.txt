ABSTRACT
1. A dispatch had been prepared outlining the various administrative
and operational details pertinent to the WIROGUE project. Receipt of re-
ference B negated its value and we prepared this one in its stead. Suffice
it to say that all steps outlined in reference A vere accomplished and he
was dispatched with the specific instructions outlined in paragraph 2 of
reference с.
2. During WIROGUE/1's association with the undersigned, the subject of
a vehicle vas raised by him. He stated he needed one to accomplish his mis-
sion. It vas süggested to him that under the present circumstances in the
Congo it would not be vise to consider such a purchase until he has discus-
sed it fully with you and received your concurrence. If he did purchase a
vehicle after receiving your approval, then he would have to do it frosa his
own funds and not use funds made available to him to establish his cover
business. Obviously be has violated the suggestions.
3. While WIROGUE/1 was in the employment of REDWOOD, there was a
communication channel set up between him and his family. This was an ar-
rangement with a letter drop in Sao Paulo. He would write a letter, post
date it, and give it opened to the Case Officer who would pouch it to the
COB, Sao Paulo for mailing. Letters to WIROGUE/1 would come to a post office
box in Sao Paulo where it would be serviced by ALLAMETER-2 and pouched to the
Case Officer. We leave it to your discretion, as to whether or not you wish
to continue this type of arrangement. Nonetheless, under separate cover,
attachment A is a letter for WIROGUE/1 which was received through this chan-
nel.
4. I am cure that WIROGUE/1 will undoubtedly want you to set up a
similar arrangement through Germany for him so that he may communicate with
a female acquaintance of his in FBPRIME. We are not adverse to the idea of
his having such a channel, but only on the condition you are able to censure

ABSTRACT
1. The plans end development of the WIROGUE project have reached a point
whereby a summation of the progress made and the plans for the futüre is in
order. At this writing it is anticipated that WIROGUE/1 will be on the
Leopoldville scene on the first of December.
2. WIROGUE/1 had originally been recruited in Europe for a REDSOX operation.
He was flown to FBPPING "black" and undervent an extensive training program.
This included survival, small arms and other similar type FM training. After a
year of such training the project failed to materialise, as a result subject vas
preparing for resettlement in South America. The Ar/Division took interest in
WIROGUE/1 and after an assessment decided that with his peculiar background,
talents and general makeup he could effectively be utilised along the lines
cited in reference A. On 21 October 1960 the case was transferred officially to
the Africa Division.
3. Since that date to the present, every effort has been made to psycho-
logically orient WIROGUE/1 for this assignment and to prepare him operationally
for its fulfillment. To insure the security of the operation, prevent any
identification with ODYOKE and/or KUBARK, and to preclude any unexpected
uncovery of WIROGUE/l's past which would associate him with his pre-KUDARK Life,
a mumber of basic steps were taken. Those veres
a. WIROGUE/1 underwent plastio surgery, which changed the shape of
his nose.
b. A toupee had been made for his constant use. This and the
plastic surgery have altered him sufficiently to obviato any
recognition.

c. Documentation precred with accompanying cover story
to show that WIROGUE/l is an Austrian and who has never had ODYOKE
connections, nor ever been in FBIME. (See separate cover
attachment A).
4. It is planned at this time to take WIROGUE/1 "black" to Germany.
There he will be met by the undersigned, given his Austrian documentation,
contact instructions and letter of credit, stripped of any FBIRIME clothing
or personal effects, and dispatched. He is to proceed to Leopoldville on
his own and upon arrival make contact. The cover assignment for subject is
temporarily left open, although he has been told to look into the prospects
of opening a photo or general repair shop. He has actually done photographic
work but the decision on this we will leave to your on the spot judgment. The
letter of credit for three thousand dollars is to be used to finance this
venture. There will also be a reserve of one thousand dollars in a Swiss
account should expenses necessitate a greater outlay. This money will consti-
tuto an non-interest bearing, operational loan which must be repaid by WIROGUE/1
from profits over a period of years. All other profits after the loan is paid
off will be WIROGUE/18.:
5. A word about the manner of man with whom we are dealing. He is a
small, energetic individual, who has displayed ahrewdness, cunning, ingenuity
and inventiveness. He has a peculiar turn of mind which lenis itself remarka-
bly to nofarious and extra-legal activities. Excitement and intrigue are
important factors in his life, he relishes it and as a result may be a little
delicate to handle. WIROGUE/1 likes ordor and clear cut chains of command.
He admires the Prussian approach and as a result will take orders even if he
may disagree. It is important to him to have the trust and confidence of his
case officer. If in his own mind he feels assured of this and is confident
of the professional KUTUSE type competence of the CO, he will reciprocate in
kind. He is indeed aware of the precepts of right and wrong, but if he is
given an assignment which may be morally wrong in the eyes of the world, but
necessary because his case officer ordered him to carry it out, then it 13
right and he will dutifully undertake appropriate action for its execution
without pạngs of conscience. In a word, he can rationalise all actions. One
last thought which may be useful. Best results will probably be gotten if,
when given an assignment, he be permitted to accomplish it in his own way.
The latter is connected with his idea of trust and confidence.
