Termination of Paul D. LANGEVIN
HER: SAGO 903 dated 10 October 1953
1. Attached are a) statement of termination signed by subject
and b) agent's service record. Submision of these items
has been delayed pending receipt of Field Instruction 236-1.
Since this instruction has not been received we are submitting
the enclosures to close the record on this case.
2.
Paul D. LANGEVIN may be used for recruiting tasks before his
permanent departure from Chile in April 1954. His security
is not questioned and he has expressed a willingness to per-
form such tasks..
3. He also requests arrangements for the payment of income tax
on his earnings ouring 1953. This matter will be handled
by cable in view of time element.
4. The following explains the timing of LANGEVIN's termination:
he had been advised that he would be terminated one month
after all advances had been liquidaten. This would have
• been 30 September 1953. This ante was also chosen since
it was expected that COALIUS would take over FURIOS0 "C"
at about that time. COKONTUS did take over the project.
early in October. However, LANG VIN dia no work during the
month of September for which he would be entitled to pay-
ment, althoum he presumably was available for duty. The
last payment of 357.44 for the Leriod 1 through 31 August
195 was in addition to the liquidation or his avances
although it did not cover a over a full month fror the cate of
such liquidat on which must have occuried sometime in August.
LANGEVIN accepted this as the ist payment coming to him số
