MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
VIA:
FROM:
SUBJECT:
Deputy Director for Operations
Chief, European Division
Request for Extension of the Services of
Thomas B. CASASIN (P), Retired Annuitant,
under a Memorandum of Oral Commitment
1. Action Requested: Your approval is requested to
extend the services of Thomas B. CASASIN (P) under a Memoran-
dum of Oral Commitment for the period 1 July 1975 to 31 December
1977. The only compensation to CASASIN would be money equiva-
lent to shipment costs for a maximum of 1,000 pounds of personal
effects from Paris, France, to the United States. Since CASASIN
is an Independent Contractor, the amount of money given CASASIN
will be considered taxable income for tax year 1977.
2. Basic Data and Background: CASASIN, born 20 January
1924, has been employed by the Agency since 1949. Twelve years
of this period were spent as a Staff Employee, seven of which
were at Headquarters and five years, 1955-1960, were spent in
Tokyo. In 1962 CASASIN was assigned to Paris under nonofficial
cover as a Staff Agent. In 1972 he was converted to Career
Associate status to coincide with his cover employment with
UNESCO, a position he attained on his own initiative. CASASIN
retired as a GS-15, Step 10, on 30 June 1974 and with proper
Headquarters approvals was utilized by Paris Station as an Inde-
pendent Contractor, effective 1 July 1974. His compensation was
in accordance with the 90 percent provision of HR 20-13 a(1)
(c) (1).
3. Staff Position: Due to his growing employment involve-
ment at UNESCO, CASASIN requested, and the Paris Station agreed,
not to renew his written Independent Contract, due for renewal
1 July 1975. However, since CASASIN is willing to meet informally

with the Station, the Station requests a Memorandum of Oral
Commitment to be effective for the period CASASIN remains in
UNESCO's employ, which is expected to terminate in 1977.
CASASIN's experience as an Operations Officer and, specifi-
cally, experience and operational contacts derived through
his present employment position in Paris are sufficiently
valued by the Paris Station to request the continuation of
CASASIN's services under a Memorandum of Oral Commitment.
4. Recommendation: Your approval is requested to con-
tinue CASASIN's services under a Memorandum of Oral Commitment
for the period 1 July 1975 to 31 December 1977 with total com-
pensation being money equivalent to the cost of shipping a
maximum of 1,000 pounds of personal effects from Paris, France,
to the United States.
