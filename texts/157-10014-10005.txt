it would be helpful to have a few background first.
Senator Baker. If I may say so, so that Mr. Angleton
will not be taken by surprise, there are one or two things that
I would like to discuss. The nature of that material would be
5
similar to what you have already discussed with Rockefeller,
6
having to do with the Oswald situation and other things.
7
Mr. Angleton.
Well, to begin with, I went into OSS in
8
1943, in 1943 from the infantry. And then Iwas assigned to an
9
embryonic counter
elligence
ce unit under General
10
Donovan. My immediate
chief was James R. Murphy, who had been
11
12
13
14
15
a protegee and obtained his law degree in General Donovan's
office. And he is a practicing attorney here in Washington.
And he was Chief of X-2, which was the counter intelligence.
And during that time a number of us were put together who
had never had any experience in the subject. And that included
16

people such as Jonnie Oaks, who was the head of the editorial
page of the New York Times, and Ben Wells and a tremendous
cross-section of American life.

And there was a training intensive in this country, and
I was sent to London. And the purpose of that was to ab-
sorb the British experience, and more important the breaking
of German codes.

The breaking of the German codes, which is relevant to
our activity, was really done in England.
And by way of
digression, the Germans were using a receiver machine called

single important breakthrough of the entire war. And he had
obtained it about eitht to nine or ten years prior to the out-
break of war, when it was non-operative. And he had the
prescience to know that the systems could only be one thing,
that it would be operative in a time of war.

I give this digression simply to point out that the
fruits of that breakthrough would first go to the military
And the counter intelligence
and the military operations
use of it would be the bottom of the list of priorities, in
one sense.
But it would mean that a compromise of the material
in any fashion to the Germans would destroy the military
uses. And during the war or when the Germans went into the
war, they brought it up from 10 percent recovery to about
100 percent

And believe it was in the neighborhood of some 22,000
operational messages from the German high command. I know
the Battle of Tobruk was fought on six intercepts.
22
So our job was to make use of the counter intelligence
23
for the purpose of playing back German agents to their high
24/command. And this was an elaborate deception. And when the
war ended I would say that 99 percent of all reporting agents

And it was called the Safe Haven program.

So London was in a sense a staging area with full access
7
to British, or the fruits of British activity, going back
8
through their entire history.
And it was the advance head-

I was then sent to Italy in 1943. And I took over the

And by this time it was shifted to the Saudi bloc.

23
I left Italy in 1947 or 1948 and came back, and was
discharged and went into the Agency immediately. And during
the period I was in the Agency, of course, I had both agent
operations, long distance operations, and counter intelligence,
24
25
and some sabotage, black propaganda, infiltration.

civil war in Greece, and the revival of the international
Brigade and in fact the Soviets had built up, when they were
not fighting the war, in the post-wat period, assassinations,
and instability.

And throughout this we had very close supervision from
Mr. Murphy, and General Donovan. And we had special interest
in the Vatican, and what was happening in Berlin behind the
Curtain.

And the then acting Secretary of State for the Vatican,
Montini who is the present Pope. And so there was much
21
to do through our channels, and General Donovan, with Montini,
22
the Rope, who is now the Pope, one of the basic problems was
23
the cold war. We did not buy the cold war, it came to us
24
25
and we worked with the Germans, and as we broke down the
Fopposition, we began to find that we were not getting the

But the penetrations and the operations which wegran

during the military phase began to take on a character of
their own in the civilian phase in the very long term Soviet
objectives against the U.S. in particular, and against the
allies

And then I got into all fields of ylabor, subversion,
illegal immigrants, and then revolution. I was in Greece.
And our penetrations at that period were fairly high level and
sophisticated, because of the reaction to Stalin.

And as the Soviet troops occupied new territories, it
was faced with these ambiguities, the defectors coming
over to us at very high levels.

And in the course of this, of course, was the Israeli
immigration. Technically we were still a part of AFHQ, which
was a combined and Allied Headquarters. And the British desires
were that our activities be directed in supporting their
responsibilities in the Middle East, and, therefore, to pre-
vent the immigration.

And I think the only policy cable that was ever re-
ceived during that period was one we sent to Mr. Murphy, and
through General Donovan to the President. That
was where we exercised our influences on the Italians to
prevent immigration.
And they addressed themselves to this
issue, and they came back with an ambiguity, but it leaned

toward the general proposition that we should not
discourage the British nor hurt the British directly, but
we should not interfere with the Italians to support the
British position.

And so my dealings were with Admiral Maugeria, who
had been Chief of the Italian Naval Intelligence, but was
then the Commanding Admiral of the Turanian Fleet generally

Mr. schwarz. So you developed some kind of a relation-

Israeli back in the 1940's?

Mr. Angleton. That is right.
