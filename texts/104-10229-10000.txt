1. A letter dated 7 May 1967 has been received from Silvia
HEREDIA, 180 S.E. 13th Terrace, Miami, Florida, via the ANTIKI-1
facility. Mrs. HEREDIA is the widow of Jorge FUNDORA Fernandez
(Hero & Martyr, no 201 number) who is the Subject of Case #103 for
which a monthly AMBUD payment of $175.00 is made to the widow.
her letter, which is attached, Mrs. HEREDIA requests the AMTIKI facility
to also send the payment formerly received from AMBIDDY-1 which she
claims was terminated in April 1967.
In
2. This case was one of three cases for which AMBIDDY requested
in January 1967 that WOFACT assume tho monthly payments being made by
his organization. The request by AMBIDDY was the Subject of Reference
A which requested data from JMWAVE concerning the cases. The JMWAVE
reply, forwarded under Reference B, included a recommendation that no
increase in payment be made. Reference C informed the addressee that,
under the circumstances, it was not possible for Headquarters.t
any action to provide support to the individuals concerned.
In view of the background described above, we propose, with
Headquarters approval, to have AMTIKI-1 reply to Mrs. HEREDIA stating
that no funds are available in addition to the $175.00 monthly payment
which is being made.

situation with the hope that you can help me.
My name is Silvia HEREDIA, widow of Jorge FUNDORA, and I
have been receiving from you a pension of $175.00 monthly.
Since this sum was insufficient to cover the needs of my two
children, Eduardo who is 8 years old and Raquel who is 7 years
old, and the psychiatric treatment for myself, AMBIDDY-1
,
,
in the name of the
sent me $125.00 monthly.
In the month of August 1966, that amount (from the ) was
reduced to $100.00 for economic reasons and in the month of Apt
April 1967 I was notified that this amount would be suspended
entirely and that I should not count of this subsidy in the future.
My situation cannot be sustained because due to my health
I am not able to work at the moment and I am turning to you with
the request that the sum suspended by the
AMBIDDY-1
by
be assigned to me by you.
which was sent to me
