his experiences in the pro-ChiCom milieu in Africa and vestern Europe up to the time
of his departure from the staff of Revolution in sping 1964. This was followed up by
in-depth debriefing sessions carried out by Katzenbach in a PBSWING conference room

Subject for a test assignment in Algiers during the summer of 1965 during which time

Subject's lack of funds and a job are of primary importance. His need for
cash (evidenced to some extent by his attempt to peddle articles to China Qarterly,
Encounter and Atlantic Monthly in the fall of '64) vas critical. But of even
greater significance is his desire to effect his long-range rehabilitation in order
not to be stuck in the norass of the impecunious and "morally fraudulant" extreme left

for the rest of his life. Also important in Subject's motivation is the sense of
adventure connected with "The Game", which is enhanced by his desire to deceive
(to put one over on) those persons, such as Verges, who exploited and deceived him.
Subj. evinces deep contempt for these professional revolutionaries and what he
refers to, vith feeling, as their "moral fraud".
Control exists quite is quite strongly in the area of Subject's material welfare and

1. Pursuant to the suggestion contained in DIR 04341, 23 April 1965,
we asked JAGUAR to lay on such coverage as they could manage. After some
weeks has passed, and JAGUAR had not moved in this direction, we repeated
our request, pointing out that STEBONY/1 would soon be leaving. Short-
handed and hampered by certain restrictions, JAGUAR moved in to do what
they could, and their coverage was due to start almost at the same time
as TIFFANY was to begin his meetings with S/1. We contacted JAGUAR and
told them to lay off (much to our chagrin) for the time being. This they
did, but then, without our being advised, they resumed their coverage.
We don't know exactly how long they actually had him in their sights,
but they have now given us a letter (text below) suggesting that he was
watched on 5, 6 and 7 June. A JAGUAR officer advised us informally
that S/1 "seemed to be out of town" for one or two days. (TIFFANY had
mentioned that he might take S/1 to the country for a day, but we don't
know whether in fact he did so.)
2. Here is JAGUAR's notes
"As explained in conversation on the 8th June, 1965, we
have received a report on S/1's movements during the period 5th -
7th June, 1965. Nothing of interest was learnt about his movements
on the 6th and 7th June, but you may be interested in the following
information relating to the 5th June: -
"S/1 left his home at 11.25 and travelled by taxi to
the Haymarket where he entered the American Express offices.
He obtained a ticket for an air passage to Brussels and
a train journey to Basle, thence to Lausanne and Paris where
he was due to arrive on the 10th June. He paid 120-29-1d
for his ticket. He left the American Express at 12.30 and
subsequently returned home at 13.20 hours.
"He left home again at 14.05 and went to the Clarendon
Court Hotel in Kaida Vale. He came out of the building
after five minutes and wandered around for twenty minutes
before returning to the hotel. He stayed there until 18.45
when he left alone and returned home.
!!
3. The JAGUAR officer also told me that 3/1's contact at the Clarendon
1
Court Hotel was not identified by the surveillant, who in fact did not
know which room 5/1 had visited. The contact, of course, was TIFFANY,
registered as GUSTKE.

Personally, 8/1 appeared to understand and to follow good security
practices by and large, but be was concerned that his wife now suspected hin
of being "ap to something" of which she did not approve. In short, his overall
long-term security appeared veniet closest to Loze. Lavertheless, be appeared
highly confident that previous denunciations to which he had been subjected
would not "stick" and that he could rapidly reestablish himself awong revolutionary
circles.
Ris relationship to KUBANK over the longer period has apparently
been of considerable interest to him, to the extent that he stated he would be
interested in some sort of career status with KUBARK (with retirement benefits)
and perhaps one day a "less covert" position. At this time in our relationship
with 5/1, however, LCPIPIT is concerned primarily with what to do with his
on 1 Septessber 1965. In fact, in view of the 19-20 June developments in Algiers
and the possible postponement of sost of the activities 8/1 was to cover in
efforts to resstablish himself as a legitimate propagandist for national liber
ation movements, KUSANEK may find it not only feasible, but necessary, to revise
s/l's initial KUBARK mission.
In the days and weeks to come we will be reporting S/1's progress as
he relatas his accomplishsants and problems through s/d commanications and in
moetings with BODIJAST. te shall be subaitting recomendations on 3/1's longer
term utility to KRASK as we have more information upon which to make som
Judgments. We know that addressses will be subjecting the STEBORY operatica
to constant evaluation and analysis throughout the surser, and we will appreciate
continued and coordinated guidance on how best to exploit the unique potential
reprecented by this asset.

1. LCPIPET SUPPORT FOR THE STEBONY OPERATION
1. On 3 June 1965 SERBOWY/1 signed a letter of agreement with
ODFONE in London, in effect a contract with SUBARK. Upon signing the letter
of agreement and agreeing to undergo an LCYLUTIER exaxination, 5/1 was introduced
to Rufus P. RODIGAST, & KUWOLF Career Agent based in Paris who had been designated
8/1's outside case officer. RODIDAST is known to 8/1 under the alias "Poul
Meller." RODICAST met at length with 3/1 on 3, 5, and 6 June and made arrange-
amats for 2/1 to meet him in Paris 12 June and undergo further training, briefing,
and security processing prior to embarking on a trial assignment of some 10 weeks.
2. On 12 Jane 1965 8/1 made contact with RODIGAST in Paris in
accordance with fastructions and was taken izmediately to a safehouse for
debriefing on his 8-11 June trip in West Europe and for training in the es
of S/W system 64. RODIOBST's Contact Report on this meeting and his report of
the debriefing are included in Attachment 3 (USC.). 5/1 was passed $200.00
tom
travel arrangements for his trip to Forth Africa. (See also PALP 4057).
3. On 13 June 3/1 again met RODIJAST in accordance with instructions
and was taken to his LVLUFTISER examination at an LCPIPIT safehouse. The results
of this examination vere forwarded in PALP 4056. In short, the outcome of the
examination was considered asticfactory for the oroecsed operetional me of s/1.

SECRET/KAPOK
OPLA 2555
4. On 14 and 15 Jane RODIJAST again met with 8/1 for further
debriefings on the latter's contacts in Paris. RODICAST then briefed him on
KUTUER requirements for BIKE and passed on the requirments at Fion
forwarded in DIR 18107 and DIR 18675. RODIGAST's reports on these setinga
are also included in Attachment 8 (USC). On 14 June 5/1 was passed $500.00
as an advance on his per dies and travel expenses for his next seeiing with
RODIGAST. BODIGAST considers 5/1 an apt student who learned the S/W system
well in some two hours of instruction. Paris KURIOT Officer DONARY noted
soma carelessness on 8/1's part in the test messages, and this was subsequently
brought to 5/1's attention in the overall security briefing he received fro
RODIGAST.
5. The communications syaten established with 5/1 consists of
pre-arrenged meeting sites and times, a one-way S/W system, and the use of the
classified advertising section of the Algiers El Foud Jahid (received daily in
Paris) by 5/1 to signal a postponement of meeting dates. The one-way syston vas
chosen for this initial stage of the agent's operational relationship with KUBARK
for reasons of securitys given the operational climate in Algiers and the
specific circles in which 3/1 must cove, and adding to the sudéen political
upheaval in Algeria, 3/1 would not be in a position to receive incoming commun-
ications safely. As of 23 June 3/1 had initiated S/W correspondence, his initial
effort being clearly legible and the content operationally worthwhile. (Ses
Attachment P).
6. The next RODIOAST contact with 8/1 is scheduled for 15 July in
Romo. (Sea OFLA 2538 for LCPIPIT's request for Rome Station support.) In
view of the events that have just taken place in Algeria the seeting may well
be concerned as much with rethinking 3/1's operational objectives for the
period following 16 July as with debriefings, briefings, and passage of funds.
Even though latest indications are that Banchang II will prcosed as scheduled,
it is questionable whether the AAJA or the Afro-Asian Komen's conference will be
held in Algiers this sLEIST. Moreover, there is no assurance at this writing
that MEMINCE will not be either postponed, canceled, or moved elsewhere. Add
to this the possibility that LDEN A might be on the scene profiting from the
sudden rise in the political fortumes of his friends, and Algiers suddenly
Losss some of its appeal as an area in which to carry out a msaningful test
of 5/1's operational capabilities. The next three weeks will tell us much
and perhaps allay many of our apprehensions.
7. Bevertheless, RODIGAST must be prepared to handle a number of
eventualities in his 15 July meeting, not the least of these being a possible
revision of 8/1's mission. The following possible alternatives present thes-
solves; we ask Readquarters to address its attention to thes and to other
developmental targets and to cable recommendations and guidance prior to 13
Julys

A. 8/1 to remain on site, contime his efforts to establish
credentials and find a job in Algiers, or elesbere, in the national liberation
movement, and report on political developments in Algeria.
B. 4/1 to travel to Dar es Salaam to look into the job offer nede
some time ago by Dennis PROGEAR.
C. 8/1 to proceed to Brussels to continue development of IDEN B
(ate OFIA 2541).
D. 8/1 to return to London to write up reports and operational
proposals and polish up the translation of IDEM B's book.
B. 8/1 to follow the KPDICE caravan wherever it may lead (perhaps
Bofia?) and continue to lock for job leads (outside the Bloc).

8. The second BODICAST meeting of the summer with 5/1 is tentatively
scheduled for the second week in August, site to be determined. Addreesses will
know that &/1's wife is expecting their third child o/a 11 August and that 8/1
intends to be in London at that tism if at all possible. Although he told
RODIGAST he would forego a visit to London at that time if it were operationally
szary, he would find it difficult to justify his absence to his wife unless
he were to have a truly Blausible and urgent cover assignment. We must therefore
anticipate in all likelihood that 5/1 will be out of action for host of the
second week of August. In any event, RODIGAST will probably be able to meet
8/1 somewhere in Europe when 3/1 returns to be with his wife and will at that
time hope to be in a position to discuss with 8/1 the best employment of his
talents for the balance of the three-month contract period and to pursue with
his his longer range utilization as well. Headquarters views, then, are needed
both with respect to the wenke inmediately following the 15 July meeting
referred to in the previous paragraph as well as with respect to the post-
August period.
9. Adsinistratively, LCPIPIT has so far funded 5/1 to the extent
of $700.00 and has initiated action to have his salary and nonsccountable
operational advance deposited to his Swiss bank account. Thess paysants are
being made in advance because of 5/1's initially pressing financial needs.
It is our understanding that the 1 July and 1 August 1965 deposits of $600.00
to 8/1's Swiss bank account will be effected securely and on time through
BIWAD/1 (ace DIR 20944 and DIR 21703). Action was also taken to clarify the
question of 5/1's per diem. We have received his initial accountings for travel,
per dien, and operational expenses for the period 8 - 12 June.
10. Of the basis of information available to LCPIPIT, 8/1 has received
the following payments from KUSAK since he was first contacted in London by
George H. KATZENBACH in January of this year (we have no record at hand of the
KUBAEK funds passed 3/1 by FAIHNAN of KHRIESIS):
