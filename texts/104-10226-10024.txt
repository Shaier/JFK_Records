Operational/Proposed AMFRAME Operation
REFERENCES: A. AMSCROLL Quarterly Progress Report
for period 1 July 30 September 1967
B. UFGW-6699

1. Please pouch additional information about the
proposed development of "the new AMFRAME organization" in
order to enable Hoadquarters to determine if there is any
conflict with the intent of the LNLOFT action approving
the termination of AMSCROLL.
2. As you may recall, it was originally thought that
distribution of economic data might be handled by AMHIM,
after termination of ANSCROLL, possibly by creation of an
AMHIM economic desk staffed by former AMSCROLL employees.
In any event, neither Headquarters nor LNLOFT anticipated
that the termination of one organization would be followod
by development of another conducting the same operational
activities. On the contrary, our presentation to LNLOFT
emphasized further reductions of organizational support.
3. In addition to a detailed description of the
proposed organization and related administrative and operational
cost estimates, please forward more information abont plans
for distribution of the new series.

1. Station JMWAVE forwards by soparate cover material that we be-
liovo will be useful per paragraph 1.4. of reference A. Wo are forward-
ing only the basic material from which Santiago can make selections and
can re-work into any desired format. Included is a collection of AUSCHOLL
economic studies which heavily emphasizes and documente Cuban mismanage-
ment of its sugar industry which of course is Cuba's principle source of
foreign currency. In addition, there are analysos of other foreign trade
problems such as the difficulties in obtaining adequato shipping, problems
with products other than sugar sent to Canada and Europe for sale, as well
as internal production and distribution difficulties. Also included are
the texts of statoments to the press given by senior defectors from the
Cuban regime who were surfaced by the ANSCROLL organization. All of those
statoments discuss, ofton in considerablo dotail, the economic probions
facing Cuba with which these individuals wore personally knowledgeable.
Also included is a folder concerning studios of Free World shipping with
Cuba.
2. Though somo: of this material has been released to the press and
all of it provided to AMSCHOLL's mailing list of commercial, shipping,
and financial firms that are interested in or are dealing with Cuban com-
wercial organizations, it is accurate to say that this material has not
received widespread publicity and therefore we believe that it should be
helpful for your purposos. For the immediato future we will air mail
additional information of this kind to Santiago's overt mailing address
as such items come to our attention.

"UNIDAD" MOONTHLY, USSUE No. 39, JULY, 1967.

a) RUSSIA PENETRATES ARABS OIL MARKETS: A complete re-print of our own news release
on Soviet offers of oil to Spain, Great Iritain, Switzerland, and other free-world
countries. This is related to Soviet resales of Cuban sugar in the free world mar
ket, which provides the USSR with some hard currency at the expense of Cuba.

A) CURA: FIRST TERRITORY OF THE AMERICAS THAT DEPENDS ON THE USSR:
The nerve of the Reds, who claim that Quba is the first "free" territory of the
Americas. Cuba is, in fact, the first territory of the Americas that depends al-
most completely on the Soviet Union, economically speaking. Economic dependency
can be illustrated in terms of foreign trade, and Cuba's trade with the Soviet Floc
has increased as follows: Exports, from 2.2% in 1959 to 90% in 1966; Imports, from
0.1% in 1959 to 78.6% in 1966. Cuba has also mortgaged her sugar production to the
Soviets, and, as a result from this dependency, has lost her trading power in the
free-world mrket, thus becoming still more dependent of the Soviet Bloc. No wonder
Kosygin travelled to Cuba to scold his bearded puppet.

৮) CARTOON: Sign reading "Arab boycott" is hung on Arab's oil pump, while the Russian
happily collects from a free-world customer the price of the oil he has just sold
him.

a) Continuation of front-page story on Soviet penetration of Arab oil market.

b) A MESSAGE TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE "ECUADOR" SUGAR MILL: We take the problems faced
by the "Ecuador", as outlined in the EIR, and ask the management of the mill whether
they have been able to solve each and everyone of those prchlems.

c) Box: CUBAN: Cooperate with the struggle against the Red tyranny. Circulate this
issue of UNIDAD after you have read it. Also send your comments and suggestions to
