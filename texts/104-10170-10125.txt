ias informaciones quellemn de nuestra Patría aseguran un estado latente
de rebeldía, actividades de sabotages violentos y pasivos, inconformidad en los
lebros de laz er armadas, grandes preocupac os en las esferas del g
bierno y un malestar general en el pueblo cubano.
hay dudas que el Flan do Alpha 66 contribuye en alguna proporción a es
tos fenómenos. Primero anunciamos el desembarco de Vicento Menież antes del 31
de diciembre con otros hambres, apesar de las dificultades conocidas, ce cumplió
en gran medida la prezesa. Murió en el hecho el Capitan Julio Cesar Raziraz.
Sin esperar mucho tiempo, se produjo la gran commoción Mundial ol 17 de Abril
con la presencia y los combatientes del Coronel Vicante Néndez y el myor contin-
Gente que llego a tierras cubanas, deagea de 1961.
En mayo, hombres del Alpha 66 hundieron 2 embarciones cubaras e hicieron 11
prisioneros comunistas, reritiondo otra conmoción Mundial que motivé el escarialo
mayor escenificado por el traidor Fidel Castro y su mayor derreta moral do dos ul-
ticos tiempos. El gran triunfo lo corsigna el pueblo de Cuba en distintos infor
nes que poscemos de muestras células clardestinas.
Otros movimientos positivos de distintas indoles se produjeron, unes con d
to y otros frustados por las autoridades norteamericanas; pero en fin todos destina-
dos a golpear duramente al tirano y alentar y respaldar a los hombres de Lac mon-
tañas y los grupos clandestinos que se juegan todos los dias sus vidas en aras du
la libertad.
Con estos antecedentes de gran valor y valides, azén de mas de 20 acciones co-
mandos y de infiltraciones realizadas por nuestros ma destoendos hombres y por
ura pleyade de patriotas que combatieron y combaten en todos los frentes de accion
cubana, nos sentimos coralmente respaldados para promover un Hamertente en pone-
ral a los cubanos de la Isla a los cubanos del dustierro, a la guerra libertado-
ra. No pretendemos convertirmos en sectaristas, sino que cada cual que capuña el
arma que tenga, la actividad que sea compatible a sus posibilidades, la colabora
ción economica y el apoyo moral, a los que combaten y sobre todo, a los que en la
Isla can la pauta y lleven el mayor peso en la contienda. Sin demora tenemos que
a cometer acciones vitales para que éste gran momento historico ciaje en la libera-
ción definitiva de Cuba.
Ademas de coontirar las cuestiones internes con otros grupos clandestinos,
Alpha 66 esta distrubuyerão cientos de millares de pequeños pantleticos convidan-
do a las milicias, at Ejercito Rebeldo y al pueblo a participar de la contienda en
contra del Castro-Communismo. Todos los cubanos que deseen cooperar a este
ma-
miento pueden pasar por miestras oficiras para entregarles el material que deben
enviar a Cuba. Cada cubano puede servir de puente entre los de dentro y de Suera:
Por último, demandames de todos los cubanos y de las organizaciones que pace
mos de las pal. Cras a los hechos. Que las disputas, las divisionca y las querellas
infecundis se eliminen y se convierta cada uno en un esforzado militante de la
causa cubara. lo requieren los hombres y mujeres quo en las carceles costierea la
gallarta rebeldía racional, los combatientes de todos los frentes y el pueblo en-
clavizado. Iongamos la tragedia de nuestro pueblo por encima de mesquinor intero-
ses y daños cada cubano un impulso y el apoyo moral y muerrero a la epopera ib
tadora. De este modo prezos regresar a nuestra Patria con la frente limpia y el
corazón henchido de orgullo porque supimos conquistar el derecho a cer libres.

ALPHA 66 INFORMA:
Reportes que nos llegan desde nuestras células militantes dentro de Cuba, determinan
que las acciones iniciadas por nuestra Organicación, que er ura de sus etapes cumino
con el desembarcs aul Coronel Vicente Méndez el 17 de Abril en Criente, estan tenien-
do repercusión en otras provincias de la isla.
No es sólo en Oriente donde las fuerzas internas han respondido al estímulo exterior
representado por las acciones de Alpha óó; en Camagüey, por ejemplo, se han produci-
do reiterados brotes de rebeldía traduciaos en sabotajes, resistencia y en algunes
casos enfrentamiento directo con el régimen.
La situación en Oriente, desde luego, es la que revela con mayor claridad la decisión
del pueblo cubano de sacudirse el jugo que lo oprime. A tal extremo que los propios
medios de publicidad del Gobiomo comunista de Cuba han tenido que informar sobre
se debe a "rovi-
"grandes concentraciones de las Fuerzas Armadas", en esos sectores
lizaciones para incrementar la producción", cuando lo cierto es que la fracasada za-
fra de los 10 millones, ya practicamente ha terminado.
Las movilizaciones no han tenido otro objeto, según los reportes que hemos recibido,
que frenar le ola de deserciones que se han venido produciendo en las filas de los
Fuerzas Armadas y cubrir territorios en los cue actúan eficazmente los patriotas cu-
banos.
Que el régimen de Castro está consciente de la pravocad del momento lo demuestra en-
tre otras cosas, la intensa purga que se está llevando a cabo en las mas altas este-
ras del Gobierno, y que comezaron con la cesantia fulminante de José Llause, sono
Kinistro de Educación y Francisco ladron, como ministro de la Industria Azucarera.
Los desplazamientos de distintos elementos de les importantes cargos que venien sou-
pando continúan especialmente en los "Estacos Mayores" de ins Fuercas Armadas, & al
extremo, de que se da por segum la destitución del Comandante Guillermo dareit Frias.
Jefe cel Partido Comunistra en la provincia de Oriente, quien ha caldo en "Desgracia"
debido a su importancia para contener a les invasores de Alpha 66 y a los clearates
que en esa provincia se han sumado a las acciones.
Este estado de cosas ha llegado a tal situación explosiva, que se esperan en el sar-
so de lo que resta de éste zes importantes acontecimientos que daran un giro avem-
ble a la rebeldía cubana frente al régimen despotico que ocupa el poder.
Ese es en síntesis, el resumen de los informes que hemos recibido donde giguran dites
aún más concretes que de revelarse pormenorizadamente, pudieran acarrear graves peli-
gros a elementos que actuan activamente en esas dos provincias mencionadas.

At least six Latin countrics soom coger to dump the Red

SSAUL BETHEL
On April 17 (the anniversary of the
1961 Bay of Pigs fiasco) the Cuban exile
military organization Alpha-66 landed
13 comimandos on the east coast of Cuba.
They allegedly were captured, but if so
only after Fidel Castro threw an esti-
mated 25.000 troops into the fray. Cas-
tro lost several men as well.
Then on May 6,Alpha-66 "naval units"
sank, in Cuban waters, two of Castro's
high-scas fishing trawlers (used, as well.
for spying and intiitrating guerrillas into
Latin America).
These two actions set off a chain of
events in Washington that would have
done credit to the LBJ and JFK Ad-
ministrations. With Castro massing his
mobs for a circus of protest, the State
Department hit the panic button and on
May 13 called together representatives
of federal law enforcement agencies to
figure out ways to protect Castro front
further forays of this nature.
What really teed-off the State Depart-
ment was a momentary aberration by
Alpha-68 to trade 11 crew members of
the fishing vessels for the freedom of
survivors of the April 17 landing. They
soon thought better of it and sent a tele-
gram to the Red Cross giving the loca
tion of the men and asking that they be
returned to Caba.
'CIA Invasion"
:
Meanwhile, Castro staged a denson-
stration in front of the former U.S. Em-
bassy in Havana, which is now being
used by the Swiss governinent. He
charged the Swiss, who represent U.S.
interests in Cuba, with complicity in
what he called a "CIA invasion" by
mercenaries.

Back in Miami, federal actir.
on State Department interpretation o
antiquated neutrality laws entered Alpha
65 headquarters. The search warrant
alleged that there was evidence that
1( Al66-בלק had launched its attacks
from U.S. territory: 2) Cubans were
raising funds illegally for bellicos pure
poses; and 3) all of this was teing done
to attack a nation with which the U.S
is "at peace, to wit: Cuba."
Of the 37 items impounded, those of
military significance were "one large
carton filled with military-type web
cquipment...one military-type ficid
pack...and one farge cardboard carton
filled with plastic military-type can-
teens." With such evidence, Army-
Navy surplus stores could be indicted.
Greater attention was given to files
containing the names of contributors.
These held special interest because the
wording in the warrant found "financial
contributions and disbursements to ob-
taia boats and other supplies" possibly
prosecutable.

were applied Impartially, how neay

"We conclude," the sigantaries said,
"that this part of the rocky laws
cannot be applied against Cuccas who
are fighting for freetom."
Sen. Strom Thurmond (R.-C.C.)
and Rep. William C. Crammer (2.-F.)
strongly support the Cuban exiles in their
interpretation of the law.
One of these subterfuges, say the exiles,
is a recent indictment against Andrés
Nazario Sarpen, head of Alpha-66.
Sargen is charged with havin: "cor-
frora a U.S. arsenal in Connecticut.
His bail was set at $100,000, then in-
explicably reduced to a mere $2,500
and Sargen asked to plead guilty to be
let off on a light sentence.
These shenanigans, say the Cubars,
mean that lacking proof that Alpha-
CS launched its attacks from U.S. soil,
the government will use other means
to intimidate exile action groups. Legal
activa taken against Sargin, they argue,
is imply the caper-beaverism on the
part of what they believe to te pro-Cas-
tro functionaries in the Department of
State,
On the other hand, the Department
of State has its case. Many officials are
oniy slightly less enthusiastic than Cuban
crites to see the end of Castro's Com-
munist regime. Dat they argue that the
haif measures taken by Cuban exile
groups are not effective and merely serve
to-embarrass the United States, Others
claim that the Alpha-66 attacks were
merely ill-timed, providing Castro with
an "excuse" to lay the failure of his
sugar crop at the feet of "CIA opera-
tiyes" based in the United States.
As to this latter claira, those who know
Fidel Castro also know that he needs no
excuse to gather the mobs and denounce
the United States. The history of his
10 years in power bears full witress to
the truth of this view.
Co Viablo Policy
What really conies through in all of
this is that Washington has yet to come
up with a viable policy toward Fidel
Castro to put a stop to his subverting
Latia America and even the United States.
The only absolute factor in the conduct
of foreign affairs is the premium placed
en initiative. We don't have it; Castro

According to the heads of exile action
coups called to his office, the repre-
entative stressed that "the spirit as
cil as the law" will be upheld. He is
id to have told them that fund-raising
or a bellicose purpose is definitely out-

DATE: 16 October 1970
1. In a 13 Oct 70 interview with Johnny O'Donnell, free-lance
reporter, he made the following information available regarding
subject matter: The head man is Miguel Talleda, who is employed
as an accountant at Hammer of California, Gardena. He has four
daughters, two sons, and his wife baby-sits for neighbors in order
to earn extra money. He receives about $1,000 a month. Talleda
appears to be honest, hard-working, well disciplined and well
organized, not overly emotional, strongly anti-Communist and anti-
Castro. According to the Los Angeles Police Department, he has a
P.O. Box in his name in Alhambra. The No. 2 man is Nextor Aranguren,
also an accountant. He lives in Alhambra, and is believed to be the
"bag man" who handles all money collected by the organization. It
is the custom of Alpha 66 to inform their supporters how much money
they receive. The rally in April 1970 at the Embassy Auditorium in
Los Angeles netted them approximately $2,200.
2. One of the staunch supporters of Alpha 66 is a Dr. (fnu)
DeCespedes, PhD, the granddaughter of Carlos Manuel DeCespedes, the
Father of the Cuban independence who fought against the Spanish in
1868. She spoke at the Maywood American Legion Post Alpha 66 Rally
in August 1970.
3. The following are Southern California city delegates: Eligio
Vichot from Redondo Beach; Lorenzo Alfonso, from Fullerton, their
most fiery speaker, who owns a janitorial service business; Pedro
Sanchez from Culver City; Marcos Peralta, Huntington Park. Sanchez,
Peralta, and Talleda flew to San Francisco with top man Andreas Nazario
Sargeant of Miami when he visited Los Angeles in August 1970.
4. O'Donnell said the Alpha 66 training camp is somewhere in
Mexico but they may move it to Central America as the Cubans are
worried that the Mexicans might sell them out.

5. From what O'Donnell has been able to piece together from
meetings and discussions with Alpha 66 members, he believes another
raid attempt into Cuba will take place in about four-five months.
He will continue to apprise us of what he learns.

Case 55515 - Alpha 66 Activities in Los Angeles
Your memo dtd 23 Oct 70, same subject
1. Subsequent interviews with Johnny O'Donnell resulting from
reference, disclosed he has had no personal contact with the Alpha 66
group in the last two months due to personal financial reasons. He
said his funds are depleted and he has had to spend all of his time
looking for publishers that will pay for his contributions. He was
unable to answer the questions posed in reference at this time. As
soon as he gets on his feet financially he will again make contact
with the group and try to learn more. He feels he has the complete
confidence of the group, they are looking to him for publicity, i.e.,
"to tell it like it is."
2. O'Donnell said as far as "funding channels" are concerned,
Alpha 66 does its own fund raising, such as with rallies, dinners,
and "nickel and dime" contributors. He does not know of any single
big money contributor.
3. Any information regarding Alpha 66 that comes to the atten-
tion of Mr. O'Donnell, will be passed along to us by him.
