Ferrie has a lot of old army paraphernalia in his
apartment, such as, walkie talkies, incendiary bombs, etc.
Ferrie was showing nude pictures (moving films)
to two young boys and a district police car shined a light on
his front porch and he really became frightened and uncontrol-
lable, telling Jimmy that the police must onapect him.

Jimmy stated that one Steve Littleton parked a twin-
engine beachcraft in Ferrie's spot at the airport, and that
their plane was flown in from out-of-town. It is at Ferrie's
disposal. He also heard Ferrie and Littleton talking about a
little island somewhere and they were interested in knowing if
they could land the beachcraft on this island.
