1. Concerning as part of Section 12 of the CPR on Mikhail
Vasilyevich KURIACHEV (201-205139), forwarded with reference, are
the following entries: Station would like to clarify
some of the information previously reported by the Station which
undoubtedly has led Headquarters to the conclusion contained in
the second paragraph immediately below.

when told that Subject (Mikhail Vasilyevich KURIACHEV 201-
205139) has been posted to Finland, Sommer (a Soviet defector)
commented that Subject ( ) probably be responsible
for penetrating the police.

(This speculation by Source is probably not correct since
this responsibility belongs to Petr Nikitovich, who
arrived in Helsinki about the same time that Subject did, to
replace Ivan Yefimovich SERGEEV.)
2. Petr Nikitovich SAVE (201-140430), Counsellor of
Embassy and head of the Press Section. SAVELYEV filled the
Counsellor slot vacated by Vasiliy Vasilievich SOLOKO (201-142338)
who dealt with trade.  I do not recall the Chief of the Press
Section prior to SAVELYEV's arrival, however, SAVELYEV was NOT
the replacement for Ivan ANNOYEV (201-259447) as stated in
075447, 13 February 1962.

3.  We doubt very much that SAVELYEV was involved in police
penetration. His contacts in Finland (also in Norway) were for
the most part with the press 2610, 22 Nov 1964, etc.) and
he circulated freely in that mein. Considering that SAVELYEV did not speak
Finnish, despite the fact that VALINE informed us he spoke fairly
good Finnish (5447) which was probably an initial assessment
on their part. 22
4. Although a CD suspect during his tour in Norway, his

activities in Helsinki at first appeared to be those of a NOB
co-optee, and later more obviously those of an officer in the
CA field. Walter R. CLASSIUSERY's contacts with SAVELYEV took
place either in press circles or in the presence of Aleksey
SLUMAROV (201-205095) whom we suspect of being the deputy rezident
in Helsinki. Thus the milieu in which SAVELYEV operated, we
tend to place him in the 235 category rather than 030.
and
5. SAVALYEV, who left for home leave on 10 July 1966 never
returned, was replaced by NGS officer Albert AKULOV (231-232590),
first secretary and press attache.
6. Concerning Ivan Yefimovich SERGEYEV (201-259447), SERGEYEV
replaced as officer Grigoriy Ye. GALUB (201-150156), Chief of
the Consular Section. After the defection of ANELIK/1, this
Section was in confusion and the exact slot-for-slot replacements
are not known. In our best judgment, SERGEYEV was replaced by
Anatoliy PAVLOV (201-331811) who departed 2 March 1963 because of
ill health. PAVLOV was temporarily replaced by an officer Denis
Vasilyevich PERELETOV ostensibly assigned to the Cultural Section
(220FLA-633, 6 March 1964) who departed 31 March 1964 also because
of ill health. PERELETOV was replaced for consular responsibilities
by KGB officer Feliks Dmitryevich KARASEV (201-736991).
